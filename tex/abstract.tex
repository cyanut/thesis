\Gls{ad} is characterized by progressive memory loss. While \abeta{} is widely implicated in the pathophysiology of \gls{ad}, how an impairment of neural function on the molecular and cellular level by \abeta{} creates cognitive deficits in \gls{ad} is still unknown. To investigate the circuitry deficit in the \gls{ad}, I first developed a miniature fluorescent microscope for \textit{in vivo} calcium imaging. We have showed that the mini-microscope is able to image hundreds of neurons in hippocampal \gls{ca1} simultaneously in freely behaving mice. Moreover, we have shown that the mini-microscope is able to imaging deep brain regions such as \gls{la}, and in two different colour channels. 

We then used the mini-microscope to image in a mouse model of early \gls{ad}, TgCRND8, and hypothesized that an impairment of circuitry function underlies the cognitive deficit in these mice, and that rescuing the behavioural deficit by enhancing \gls{ltp} is able to restore the circuitry function of the \gls{ad} mice. We trained the \gls{ad} and \gls{wt} mice in contextual fear conditioning while imaging dorsal hippocampal \gls{ca1} neurons using the mini-microscope. We found while the \gls{ad} mice shows a deficit during memeory test, the memory deficit is present as a significantly shortened freezing bouts, but without a significant decrease of the number of freezing bouts. Mini-microscope recording data show that \gls{ca1} cells in the \gls{ad} mice has significant hyperexcitability and less information content about memory recall. Moreover, we have found the pattern completion process, which is important for recalling hippocampal dependent memory, is impaired in the \gls{ad} mice, represented as a lack of coordination between \gls{ca1} neuron activities. 

Moreover, we found that blocking \gls{ampa} endocytosis using \tglu{} is able to rescue both the behaviour and circuitry deficit in the \gls{ad} mice. Furthermore, we have also found that the memory deficit in the \gls{ad} mice is a deficit of memory recall, since \tglu treatment during a reminder one day ofter training is able to rescue the memory deficit, suggesting \gls{ad} mice can still retain the memory one day after training. 

In this thesis, I have shown that new development in calcium imaging is able to help study the circuitry function of the brain. In the \gls{ad} project, the results suggest that the abberation of neural circuitry function is important in producing the cognitive symptoms in \gls{ad}. Our findings also provide a link from cellular deficit in \gls{ad} to neural circuitry and finally behavioural deficit.
