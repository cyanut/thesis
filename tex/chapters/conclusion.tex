\section{Construction of the mini-microscope}
\subsection{advantage of current mini-microscope}
In the current project, we have constructed a miniature microscope which weighs less than \SI{3}{\gram}. The light weight of the mini-microscope allows implantation on mice without significantly alters the mice's natural behaviour.  This miniature microscope is able to image green fluorescence at a resolution of at less \SI{2}{\um}. Using a tail vein injection of the fluorescent dye, dextran-fluorescein, we are able to resolve individual red blood cells in capillary blood vessels, and measure the flow rate of the blood the capillaries. 

Moreover, we have shown that the mini-microscope is able to record calcium transients from GCaMP-expressing neurons. Using the mini-microscope, we are able to image more than \num{200} \gls{ca1} neurons simultaneously, and identify potential place cells from the recording. Furthermore, with the addition of a thin relay \gls{grin} lens, we are able to extend the imaging capability of the mini-microscope to deep brain region with minimal damage to the tissue. Here we have demonstrated simultaneous recording of more than \SI{40} neurons in \gls{la} when the animal is undergoing auditory fear conditioning. 

In this project, we recorded the calcium transients at a rate of \num{20} frames per second, but this does not represent a limit in the frame rate. With the XIMEA camera (MU9PM), the recoding rate can reach up to \num{200} frames per second at a cost of exposure and spatial resolution. A higher frame rate will allow identification of fast brain oscillations such as the \SIrange{7}{11}{\hertz} theta oscillation and potentially the fast \SIrange{40}{100}{\hertz} gamma oscillation, both of which have been shown to be important in learning and memory. Calcium imaging is especially suited for detection of brain oscillation, as these oscillation may not leads to action potentials, but create sub-threshold changes of membrane potential which is reflected by a fluctuation of internal calcium concentrations. The ability of simultaneous imaging a dense ensemble of neurons allows the brain oscillation to be measured in each cell, and the \gls{snr} in detecting these oscillations can be increased by averaging signals from all cells and even background fluorescence. The brain oscillation signal can then be related to neural activities to study how local neural circuit response to the brain oscillation. 

In the current project, we have also demonstrated the ability of the mini-microscope to image in both red and green channels. The extra colour channel can be used for the identification of neural subpopulation or extra information for the brain. In our prototype we used blue light to stimulate red retrobeads and the fluorescent protein tdTomato, both of which have a broad excitation spectrum. However, this requirement is usually not necessary. If the red channel is static, it can be captured by a separate mini-microscope with an efficient excitation \gls{led} and corresponding filters just for the red fluorophore. The resulting image can be later aligned with recording of calcium transients for cell identification. 

Our design of mini-microscope costs \$\,300--\$\,1000 for each unit, which will not represent a significant expense in most neuroscience laboratories. Moreover, all components of the mini-microscope are commercially available and can be assembled with minimal tools, providing access to neuroscientists with no requirement of engineering experience. The microscope casing is 3D printable. We will make both the 3D models and relevant analysis code freely available in order to open this work to the neuroscience community.

\subsection{advantage of using the mini-microscope in the \gls{ad} project}

As a test of the usefulness of the miniature microscope, we used it to image \gls{ca1} neurons a transgenic mouse model of \gls{ad}, TgCRND8, when the mice are encoding and recalling a contextual fear memory. We are able to image more than \num{100} neurons simultaneously for each mice, and this data enabled us to investigate hippocampal circuitry mechanisms in \gls{ad}.

The importance of the mini-microscope in understanding neural circuitry mechanisms is particularly reflected in the classifier prediction result. We have found that the \gls{nbc}, which predicts the mice's behaviour by considering individual neurons, is unable to reveal the pattern completion deficit in the TgCRND8 mice. This result suggest that a significant amount of information the neurons encoding is contained in the synergy between activity of neurons. This information cannot be revealed using traditional methods such as \textit{in vivo} electrophysiological recording, where only several neurons can be recorded at the same time. To compensate for the lack of number of neurons simultaneously recorded, electrophysiological recordings often needs to repeat the same behaviour trial for many times, which may lead to change of the animal's behaviour and potential confound in the interpretation of the data. However in the current study, the mini-microscope gave us the freedom to choose an experimental paradigm which is well-established in the field of behavioural neuroscience. This freedom allowed us to connect the findings from the neural activity recording to the rich findings of the behavioural neuroscience. This is in contrast to the \textit{in vivo} 2-photon imaging, where due to the requirement of head fixation, only specifically designed behavioural paradigms are compatible, where the neural mechanisms for those are less well understood. 


\section{Examining circuitry deficit in a mouse model of \gls{ad}}

\subsection{\gls{ca1} hyperexcitability}
We found that in TgCRND8 mice, \gls{ca1} neurons are more active than those in the \gls{wt} mice, both during context exposure and during contextual memory recall. \tglu{} treatment during training is able to reduce the overall cell activity to \gls{wt} level. Moreover to control for the behavioural state of the mice, we investigated cell activity when the mice were freezing and non-freezing. We found the TgCRND8 genotype has a significant major effect in increasing the cell activity during freezing, and \tglu{} treatment reduces the cell activity in both \gls{wt} and TgCRND8 mice. When the mice were not freezing during memory test, only TgCRND8 mice treated with \tglu{} has a significant decrease of cell activity compared to the other three groups. 

Our results confirm the previous findings that \gls{ca1} cells in \gls{ad} are hyperactive \citep{palop16}. We have also found that while during memory test the average cell activity in \gls{wt} mice is at the same level as it is during contextual exposure, the cell activity in the TgCRND8 mice have an increase of cell activity during memory testing compared to the memory encoding session (Figure~\ref{f.ad.actdiff}). This result suggests that in addition to the hyperactivity introduced by \gls{ad} pathology, the TgCRND8 mice show additional activity in response to the memory recall task. This finding parallels those found in human patients in early \gls{ad}, where \gls{fmri} studies have found hyperactivity in the hippocampus only during memory recall, and that this negatively correlates with memory performance \citep{sperling09, reiman12, kunz15}. It has been hypothesized that this task-dependent increase of hippocampal cell activity may be a compensatory mechanism in response of degraded hippocampal function in \gls{ad} \citep{kunz15}.

While the hyperexcitability in \gls{ad} is present when the mouse is freezing, the cell activity when the mice is not freezing is not different between groups. Considering that the majority of \gls{ca1} cells lower their activity during freezing, it is possible that the hyperactivity of \gls{ca1} neurons is caused by an inability to keep silent. This is congruent with the \gls{nmdar} pathology in \gls{ad}, where the \gls{nmdar} is found prone to spontaneously activate in \gls{ad}, and excite the neuron \citep{danysz12}, the spontaneous activities of the neuron can be masked by external input. This result is also hinted at by \citet{cheng13}, who investigated spatial encoding in another mouse model of \gls{ad}. When the mouse is in the receptive field of the place cell, the cell is normally active. However when their mouse is outside the receptive field of the place cell, the cell is unable to stop firing, leading to enlarged place fields \citep{cheng13}. 

It is somewhat counter-intuitive that the \tglu{} treatment, which increases synaptic \gls{ampar} density and therefore strengthens excitatory synapses, results in a decrease of overall neural activity in \gls{ca1}. However, considering that the hyperexcitability in \gls{ad} is hypothesized to be a result of increased \gls{ltd} and decreased \gls{ltp} in the synapse (discussed in Section~\ref{ad.synaptic}), and \tglu{} have been shown to block \gls{ltd}, it is possible that \tglu{} treatment rescues excitability by reversing the \gls{ltp} -- \gls{ltd} imbalance. It is still unclear how an \gls{ltp}--\gls{ltd} imbalance will lead to hyperexcitability. Computational models of \gls{ad} neurons suggest this may be caused by a loss of synaptic spines in the hippocampal neurons. This morphological change of the neuronal dendrites in \gls{ad} creates less hindrance for the transmission of incoming \glspl{epsp}, therefore allowing the neurons to be more excitable \citep{siskova14}. It is possible that the \tglu{} rescues the hyperexcitability by restoring the morphology of the neurons. There is a close correlation between synaptic \gls{ampar} density and spine size, and endocytosis of GluA2-containing \glspl{ampar} can trigger change in dendritic spine size \citep{hanley08}. Indeed, in unpublished data from this project \todo{include spine data?}, we have found \tglu{} treatment protects from spine density decrease in both \gls{ca1} and \gls{dg} after an acute expression of \gls{app} \todo{cite?}, supporting the possibility that the \tglu{} rescues hyperexcitability by restoring normal neuronal morphology in \gls{ad}. 

The \tglu{} treatment is only applied to TgCRND8 mice \SI{1}{\hour} before contextual fear training, however the effect of \tglu{} was present both during contextual fear training and during memory testing. This suggest that \tglu{} starts to affect cell excitability within \SI{1}{\hour}, and has long-term effects. A closer investigation of the cell activity during training show that, while the \tglu{} is able to correct average cell activity in TgCRND8 mice to \gls{wt} level, the distribution of cell activity between Tg-\tglu{} and WT-Veh is still significantly different. From the cumulative plot (Figure~\ref{f.ad.acttrain}), the distribution of the lower \SI{90}{\percent} cell activity in Tg-\tglu{} is similar to WT-Veh, however that of the most active \SI{10}{\percent} cells are similar to Tg-Veh. This difference is not present \SI{24}{\hour} later during memory testing. This suggests that the rescuing effect of \tglu{} is a gradual process which take hours to complete. Cells that are less hyperactive are first rescued, and cells with very high activity require longer time for the effect of \tglu{} to appear. Given that cells close to amyloid plaques are more excitable \citep{busche12}, it is possible these cells with very high activity are located near amyloid plaques, have more damage from the \gls{ad} pathology, and require longer time for the pathological process to reverse. 


\subsection{Contextual fear memory}

In this project, we subjected \gls{wt} and TgCRND8 mice to contextual fear conditioning, and found that while the TgCRND8 mice shows inferior memory during memory testing, this memory deficit can be rescued by \tglu{} treatment either during training, or during exposure of a brief reminder. This result suggests that the TgCRND8 mice is still able to encode the memory during training, however have deficit in recalling the memory during memory testing. Similar results have been reported previously. In another mouse model of early \gls{ad}, APP/PS1, \citet{roy16} tagged cells activated during contextual fear conditioning, and optically activate the cells during memory recall. They have found that while the APP/PS1 mice shows a memory deficit during memory recall, light stimulation of the contextual fear memory trace is able to induce memory expression. 

In order to distinguish whether the memory recall deficit is due to initiation or maintenance of memory expression, we have also analyzed the number of freezing bouts and duration of freezing bouts in the TgCRND8 and \gls{wt} mice. We have found while the TgCRND8 mice do not show significant difference in number of freezing bouts during memory test, however the duration of freezing bouts are significant shorter than that of the \gls{wt} mice. This result suggests that the TgCRND8 mice is still able initiate the memory recall, however unable to maintain it. 

\subsection{Encoding}

In the current study, we have found that cell activity in TgCRND8 mice is not as predictive of the fear memory expression as the \gls{wt} mice. On the other hand, this deficit is not reflected in the prediction accuracy of the machine learning classifiers: both \gls{nbc} and \gls{gsvm} are able to predict freezing from cell activity in TgCRND8 mice as well as in \gls{wt} mice. This discrepancy of the prediction power suggests that the hippocampal neural circuit is highly redundant, such that even the prediction power of individual neurons is negatively affected by \gls{ad}, there is no significant information loss if multiple neurons are combined to make a prediction. Similar results are found in place encoding, where while individual neurons in a \gls{ad} mouse model have degraded spatial encoding, the ensemble is still able to accurately represent the mouse's position \citep{cheng13}.  

In this study, we only recorded close to one hundred cells in \gls{ca1} for each mouse on average, and the information in the activity of these neurons is enough for an accurate prediction of the mice's fear memory recall. There are more than \num{1e4} neurons in \gls{ca1}: therefore even if under \gls{ad} pathology where individual cells' firing pattern is degraded, any downstream brain structure should still able to decode the information. This then suggest that the degradation of individual cell activity in \gls{ad} is secondary to the cognitive deficit, since to an efficient downstream brain structure, redundancy in the brain can protect information loss due to the degradation of cell activity. 

This conclusion also explains why in the preclinical population, significant \gls{ad} pathology often does not impact cognitive performance (Discussed in Section~\ref{preclinical}). Another important implication of this conclusion is that treatment for the \gls{ad} pathology alone, without any restoration of the neural network structure, will not result in a significant improvement in the cognitive symptoms. This may explain the failure of recent attempts at treating \gls{ad} with \abeta{} clearance: it is possible that even with the successful \abeta{} removal, additional intervention is still required to restore the neural network at a circuitry level.

The importance of neural network structure is also reflected in the difference of \gls{gsvm} and \gls{nbc} performance. The significantly improved performance of the \gls{gsvm} suggest that the network encodes more information than individual cells. This may be a universal phenomenon across the brain, as it is also recently found in other brain regions, such as \gls{bla}, during auditory fear conditioning \citep{grewe17}. Moreover, we find the accuracy of \gls{gsvm}, which predicts freezing based on the cell assemble as whole, is again similar to \gls{wt} mice. This suggest that when the mice is freezing, the information contained in the activity of neural network in \gls{ad} mice is unaffected. 

\subsection{pattern completion}

Given that the neural network contains enough information about freezing in \gls{ad} mice, it is then intriguing what can be the source of the memory deficit. During memory expression, the information content for the cell ensemble in \gls{ad} is not different from that of the \gls{wt} mice, it is possible the memory deficit can be detected outside of the duration where the memory is expressed. Given that the memory deficit in \gls{ad} is a deficit in memory recall, and that the process of pattern completion in hippocampus is theorized to be important in memory recall, we investigated whether this process is affected in the TgCRND8 mice.

To detect the pattern completion process, we aligned the classifier prediction accuracy to the behavioural change point of the mice (Figure~\ref{f.ad.into_f}). We found a significant drop of prediction accuracy just before the mice is freezing, both in the \gls{nbc} and \gls{gsvm}. Since the drop of accuracy happens at a time where the mice are predominantly not freezing, the accuracy drop suggests that the classifiers are (inaccurately) predicting freezing, before the mice start to freeze. 

Since the classifiers are trained on each time point shuffled, the classifiers are agnostic to the temporal dynamic of the cell activity. Therefore, the significant change of prediction accuracy before freezing must reflect changes in the pattern of neural activity itself. Moreover, the fact that the change of neural activity in \gls{ca1} is present before behaviour onset is very important in interpreting findings of the this study. Given that nature of the study is correlational, the causal relationship between the neural activity and behaviour is unclear. However, the temporal precedence of the \gls{ca1} activity suggests that the neural activity pattern is not a result of the mice's behaviour,  but likely involved in initiating the behaviour. This confirms that the neural activity difference we have found between treatment and genotype groups is a result of circuitry deficit, instead of a consequence of different behaviour of the mice. 

We have found in \gls{nbc} prediction, the temporal signature of freezing behaviour \gls{wt} precedes the other three groups. Given that the \gls{nbc} considers each cell individually, this result suggest that the activity of individual cells start to form a ``cellular signal'' for freezing, which is a measurement of the contextual fear memory recall. The findings that all groups in \gls{nbc} predict freezing before behaviour, and that they have similar temporal precedence over behaviour suggest that in \gls{tg} mice, the ``cellular signal'' for contextual fear memory recall is unaffected. 

On the other hand, we found that the \gls{gsvm} prediction precedes freezing in the \gls{wt} mice, however this is not present in the vehicle-treated \gls{ad} mice. Again, given that the \gls{gsvm} detects a network pattern of cell activity, this result suggest that in \gls{wt} mice, a ``network signal'' of freezing appears in the \gls{ca1} network, however this signal is missing from the \gls{ad} mice before freezing. 

As the \gls{gsvm} can accurate classify the behaviour state of the mice based on the neural activity, we can use the \gls{gsvm} to approximate the neural activity pattern of recalling a contextual fear memory (considering each freezing bouts as an episode of memory recall). The gradual rise of freezing prediction before the freezing behaviour therefore represents the process of pattern completion: where an incomplete freezing pattern first appears in the network and confuses the classifier to predict freezing. Over time, the pattern gets more complete, which leads to increased classifier prediction of freezing. 

It is worth noting that while computational studies often model pattern completion using a stationary pattern \citep{rolls13}, the difference of prediction accuracy between \gls{nbc} and \gls{gsvm}, as well as the different temporal dynamics of the prediction precedence suggested that the neural correlate of a contextual fear memory recall is not a stationary state, since otherwise the performance of \gls{nbc} and \gls{gsvm} should be very similar, and have similar temporal dynamics in pattern completion. Therefore, our result suggest that, even in an apparently ``simple'' memory such as the contextual fear memory, the neural correlates is dynamic: the state of the neural activity during memory recall can move between multiple states.

We found that the ``cellular signal'', as detected by the \gls{nbc}, is significantly earlier than the ``network signal'' from the \gls{gsvm}. This result reveals some detail about the pattern completion process. The pattern completion process start with individual cells changing their firing rate to that representing its activity distribution during memory expression, potentially guided by feed-forward input. However, as the memory pattern is a collection of patterns, at any single point each cell may have the activity from different patterns. Therefore at this time point, \gls{nbc}, which only classifies by examining whether the activity of individual neuron represent \textit{any} single contextual fear memory pattern. However as the cell activities are not synchronized, no significant global pattern can be detected by \gls{gsvm}. 

However, as the ``cellular signal'' grows stronger, some cell activities become synchronized, and form a partial global pattern. This global pattern then, potentially through recurrent connections, recruits more cells to join the pattern. At this time, the partial global pattern can be detected by the \gls{gsvm}, and this positive feedback loop continues until the pattern is complete. This pattern then forms an attractor of brain states, which maintains itself despite small fluctuation in the feed-forward input, and only disappears when there is a large shift of the feed-forward input which significantly deviates the neural activity pattern from the contextual memory pattern \citep{rolls13}. 

It is easy to fit the specific deficit of \gls{ad} mice within this interpretation. \gls{ad} mice show normal dynamic of ``cellular signal'', however missing the ``network signal''. It is therefore possible that the \gls{ad} mice have a deficit of pattern completion: that the positive feedback force of converting an asynchronous ``cellular signal'' to a ``network signal'' is degraded. The lack of a gradual network signal suggest that the ``network signal'' in the \gls{ad} mice is likely formed by chance, that at some point, a global pattern appear from the asynchronous activity of individual cells. 

%This interpretation has several predictions. First, it predicts that the synchronization of cell activity in the \gls{ad} mice is degraded. To test this hypothesis, we calculated correlation of the neural activity of each pair of neurons, and compared the distribution between \gls{wt} and \gls{tg} mice. And indeed, we have found that cells in the \gls{tg} mice have less correlation with each other \todo{ref correlation figure}. 

This result is also supported by reports of neural oscillation deficit in \gls{ad}. In hippocampus, the \SIrange{3}{12}{\hertz} theta oscillation and the faster \SIrange{25}{120}{\hertz} gamma oscillation are considered important for learning and memory, and are critically dependent on the integrity of hippocampal neural networks \citep{buzsaki02, colgin09}. However, both theta and gamma oscillation has been shown to be altered in rodent models of \gls{ad}. It has been reported that the progression of plaque deposition is correlated with a decrease of theta power and frequency in both mouse models of \gls{ad},and acute \abeta{} treatment in rat \citep{scott12, villette10}. Decreased oscillation power is also found in the gamma frequency, and removal of \abeta{} plaques is able to block the deficit \citep{driver07, kurudenkandy14}. The coupling of theta and gamma oscillations has also been reported to be affected in \gls{ad} \citep{goutagny13}. 

Similar oscillation deficits are also found in the human patients. \Gls{eeg} recordings in early \gls{ad} patients have shown a decreased coupling between parietal alpha and prefrontal theta oscillations, and event-related delta, theta and alpha coherences are also significantly decreased \citep{guntekin08, montez09}. Moreover, the prefrontal theta coherence increases in \gls{ad} patients treated with \gls{ache} inhibitors \citep{yener07}, suggesting a close relationship between brain oscillation and \gls{ad}. More recent studies aim to enhance the brain oscillation in \gls{ad}, and have suggested a causal relationship between the two. It has been found that deep brain stimulation at gamma frequency, both in rodent model and \gls{ad} patients, is able to improve cognitive function \citep{suthana14}. A recent study also shows that in a mouse model of early \gls{ad}, induction of gamma oscillation also reverses \abeta{} deposition \citep{iaccarino16}. 

These results suggest that the pattern completion deficit in \gls{ad} may be closely related to the brain oscillation deficit reported in the literature. However in the current study the cell activity is recorded in \SI{20}{\hertz}. The sampling frequency is unfortunately too slow to allow detection of any brain oscillation above \SI{10}{\hertz}. How a deficit in brain oscillation affects the pattern completion process in \gls{ad} can be an important topic for future research. 

Secondly, this interpretation suggests that the \gls{ad} mice may still be able to initiate freezing, however due to degraded attractor functions, unable to maintain the state of memory recall. This is supported by our findings that the \gls{tg} mice have similar number of freezing bouts, however a significantly shortened bout duration, showing a deficit in maintaining the expression of the memory but not initiating the memory. 

Moreover, the instability of the memory state in the \gls{ad} can be implied from the distance to the boundary of memory states. We measured the signed distance to the \gls{gsvm} classification boundary when the mouse's behaviour transits into freezing (Figure~\ref{f.ad.cls-distance}). We have found that while the \gls{wt} mice shows an acceleration over and away from the boundary, the \gls{tg} mice only barely cross the boundary, and stay close to it during freezing. Therefore, a small perturbation in the brain state is more likely to shift the \gls{tg} mice out of freezing. The freezing state in the \gls{wt} mice on the other hand is more robust to small perturbations.  

While the current study is the first to suggest that neural attractor states for memory recall are unstable in \gls{ad}, evidence from human behaviour studies suggest that similar dynamics may exist in \gls{ad} patients for other cognitive functions. Attention has long been considered computationally as a result of neural attractor state, and the strength of the attractor is important for maintaining attention \citep{desimone95, rolls08a, rolls13a}. Interestingly, early \gls{ad} patients have no deficits in focusing the attention, however, their attention is more likely to be disrupted by distractors, and less likely to maintain over time \citep{perry99}. This result is similar to the memory recall deficit we have found in the current study, suggesting that it is possible that the deficit in attractor state in early \gls{ad} is global, affecting many brain areas cognitive functions. 

The fragility of the memory attractor in \gls{ad} may also implicate another curious deficit of \gls{ad} called subjective memory impairment \citep{jahn13}. The subjective memory impairment is defined as a sense of memory deterioration with no objective impairment in cognitive test. The subjective memory impairment is correlated with hyperactivation of \gls{mtl} during memory tasks, and predictive of hippocampal atrophy as well as later development of cognitive impairment and \gls{ad} \citep{jahn13}. It is possible the subjective memory impairment arises from our finding that during memory recall, the network state in \gls{ad} tends to stay close to the boundary of the attractor state. This close distance can be detected by other brain regions, and reduce the confidence of those brain regions in predicting the patient's behaviour, creating a sense of unsureness, even though without a degradation of performance.  

The deterioration of the attractor state in \gls{ad} can be caused by several factors. First, we have shown that the deficit in \gls{ad} mice can be rescued by \tglu{} treatment with a reminder. From this we conclude that the \gls{ad} mice have encoded the contextual fear memory during training, but that this memory may not be encoded in the same way as in \gls{wt} mice. Therefore, the attractor state deficit can be a result of the formation of a weak attractor for the memory. Given that the neurons in \gls{ad} have impaired \gls{ltp}, and the normal memory encoding process may be interfered by hyperactive neurons, it is unlikely that the memory encoding process is completely spared. 

Secondly, it is also possible that interference exists during the memory recall. The hyperactivity observed in the \gls{ad} mice may generate noise in the network state, so even with a functional memory attractor, the network state however is more likely to spontaneously shift out of the attractor field due to noise. In addition, it is also possible that in \gls{ad}, other attractor states exists, and these sporadic attractors may actively pull the network state toward their own center of attraction, and away from that of the memory recall. This is hinted at both by animal and human studies. In a mouse model of taupathy, \citet{cheng13} have found that the \gls{ca1} place cells displayed rigid firing, such that the firing pattern of a familiar environment lingers even when the mice is place in a novel environment. In humans, \gls{mci} and early \gls{ad} patients have deficits in shifting attention, often maintain focus in the original item even when it is no longer relevant \citep{perry99}. These studies suggest that if the memory recall deficit is a result of competing attractor fields, it is possible that the competing attractor represents a strong, familiar memory formed previously. This hypothesis can be tested by artificially creating a strong attractor state, for example, using repeated optical activation of a selected neural ensemble \citep{carrillo-reid16}, before contextual fear conditioning. The hypothesis will be supported if a future experiment shows the similar pattern reappeared during contextual fear memory recall in \gls{ad} and correlates with the memory deficit. 

\subsection{\tglu{} treatment is able to rescue circuitry deficit in \gls{ad}}

In the current project, we gave the TgCRND8 mice an acute treatment of \tglu{} during memory formation. This treatment is able to rescue information content in \gls{ca1} neural activity as well as the presence of a network pattern just before memory recall, and rescues the pattern completion deficit in the TgCRND8 mice. Interestingly, while behaviourally \tglu{} had no effect on \gls{wt} mice, \tglu-treated \gls{wt} mice showed an earlier presence of network pattern before memory recall compared to vehicle-treated \gls{wt} mice. 

These results suggest that \tglu{} treatment during memory formation has a long-lasting effect. Moreover, given that the effect of \tglu{} treatment is only present only when the memory is activated, either during formation or a reminder, these results suggest that the \tglu{} treatment potentially affect memory by strengthening the underlying neural representation. A robustly-connected memory trace allows it to be reactivated with a degraded pattern, so that a small number of neurons showing the activity of a memory recall is able to synchronize the network. In fact this is what we have found: at the same level of cellular signal of memory, \tglu{} treatment, both in \gls{wt} and \gls{tg} mice, forms a network pattern with a smaller cellular signal. This suggest that on a circuitry level, the \tglu{} treatment results in an enhanced pattern completion process.

Our finding that \tglu{} treatment strengthens the memory network is congruent with literature, where \tglu{} treatment has been shown to make the memory more resilient. For example, chronic \tglu{} treatment prevents forgetting of contextual fear memory, conditional place preference, and novel object recognition \citep{dong15, migues16}. Treatment of \tglu{} also protects memory recall from protein synthesis inhibitors in auditory fear memory \citep{lopez15}. 

While our result, together with many other previous studies found that in \gls{wt} mice, \tglu{} treatment does not affect the magnitude of the memory \citep{dias12, dong15, migues16}, suggesting that the magnitude of memory, especially several days after memory formation, is not encoded in the strength of functional connections within an engram.

Given that the \tglu{} blocks synaptic \gls{ampar} endocytosis and therefore prevents \gls{ltd} \citep{ahmadian04}, it is likely that the rescuing effect of \tglu{} is mediated through synaptic plasticity. \citet{dong15} showed that \tglu{} treatment prevented \gls{ltp} from delay, and was able to rescue memory deficit in the APP23/PS45 mouse model of \gls{ad}. Moreover, it has been shown that \gls{ltp} may be sufficient to rescue memory recall. \citet{roy16} have also found while the optogenetic reactivation of contextual fear memory does not have long-term effect, a train of fast, \gls{ltp}-inducing stimulation of the memory trace is able to rescue the memory deficit in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings that the effect of \tglu{} requires a reminder of the original memory is consistent with these results: in the short-term, the activity of the original memory trace needs to be reactivated by the reminder in order for the associations to be strengthened, and without activation of the original memory, our no-reminder controls did not benefit from the \tglu{}-mediated rescuing of memory recall.

The long term effect of \tglu{} is in accordance with the idea that \gls{ad} pathology forms a positive feedback loop, that the effect of the \gls{ad} pathology including synaptic degeneration and aberrant neural activity in turn accelerates the signature pathology. In the current study, we show that an acute \tglu{} treatment is able to have lasting effect at least \SI{24}{\hour} when the \tglu{} is not longer present, suggesting that in the TgCRND8 mice, which is a model of early \gls{ad}, correcting the synaptic pathology is not only able to rescue the cognitive ability, but may also prevent feedback loop of \gls{ad} pathology in the short term. Previous report of chronic \tglu{} treatment in a mouse model of \gls{ad} results in a reduction of neuritic plaques, supporting the hypothesis that rescuing circuit function in \gls{ad} can protect neurons from the \gls{ad} pathology. While more research is required to investigate long-term effect and outcome of \tglu{} in \gls{ad}, our result and previous studies \citep{roy16, migues16, dong15} suggest that interventions that restores network circuit functions in \gls{ad} can enhance cognitive function and potentially protect the neurons from \gls{ad} pathology. 

\chapter{Conclusions and Future Directions}

\section{Conclusion}

In the current project, we sought to explore the circuit mechanism of the hippocampus function, and how its deficit contributes to cognitive symptoms in \gls{ad}. To investigate neural circuitry functions, we first designed and built a miniature fluorescent microscope for recording of neural activity in freely behaving mice. The mini-microscope is implantable on a mouse's head, combined with a calcium indicator such as gCaMP, we have shown that the mini-microscope is able to record hundreds of neurons in \gls{ca1}, and tens of neurons in \gls{la} simultaneously in freely behaving mice. In addition, we have extended the ability of mini-microscope to include a second colour channel, which can be potentially used to identify neural subpopulation and other brain structures at the same time of neural activity recording.

In the second part of this project, we used our mini-microscope to investigate circuitry deficit in a mouse model of early \gls{ad}, TgCRND8. We recorded from \gls{ca1} when the mice was learning and recalling a contextual fear memory. We have found that TgCRND8 mice have a significant memory deficit, showing less freezing during contextual memory test. This deficit is a result of significant shorter freezing bouts, but not a reduced number of freezing bouts, suggesting the memory deficit may be a result of maintaining the expression of the fear memory.

From the calcium recording, we have found that \gls{ca1} neurons in TgCRND8 mice are hyperactive, and the cell activity of TgCRND8 mice contain less information about the behavioural state of mice during memory recall, and this effect is independent of spatial location of the mice, suggesting it's a effect reflecting recall of the fear memory. 

Next, we took advantage of machine learning methods to investigate how memory information is recalled in the \gls{ca1} circuitry. We differentiates the cellular signal, where individual neurons are independently considered, and a network signal, where the activity of all neurons are considered using a \gls{nbc} and \gls{gsvm}, respectively. The two classifiers are trained on the ensemble neural activity to predict the behaviour of the mice at each time point. We have found that even though individual neurons in \gls{ca1} contain less information about the behavioural state of the mice, the ensemble of neurons is still able to create an accurate prediction of when the mice were freezing. Moreover, we have found that the \gls{gsvm} shows a significant better performance than the \gls{nbc}, suggesting that a significant amount of information is encoded in the synergy between activity of single neurons.

The performance of \gls{nbc} and \gls{gsvm} suggest that these classifiers are able to recognize a neural activity pattern for fear memory recall. We then investigated how this pattern emerge at the beginning of memory recall. We aligned the classifier predictions to the time when the mice start to freeze, and found a gradual decrease of prediction accuracy before the mice froze, where the classifiers start to falsely predict freezing before the behaviour occur. This result shows that the fear memory pattern emerges gradually before the behavioural change. This process corresponds to the pattern completion process in hippocampus. We found that in the \gls{nbc}, all groups show similar timing in the pattern completion, suggesting that in the TgCRND8 mice, cellular signal for the pattern completion is not impaired. However in \gls{gsvm}, TgCRND8 mice show no pattern completion, suggesting that in TgCRND8 mice, even though individual cells show activity pattern of freezing, these activity are not synchronized, and cannot form a pattern across the network. 

In addition, we found in TgCRND8 mice, the network state tend to linger at the classification boundary during freezing, while the other groups are able to dip into the freezing attractor state. This result suggest that in TgCRND8 mice, the attractor state for the expression of the memory is not robust, and susceptible to interruption from minor deviation. This result explains the behavioural findings that the TgCRND8 mice are unable to maintain the freezing, and more likely to be distracted. 

\Gls{ad} is characterized by significant synaptic loss, and a bias from \gls{ltp} to \gls{ltd}. Here we investigated whether rescuing synaptic function in \gls{ad} is able to restore hippocampal circuitry function and subsequently behaviour. We used the well-characterized peptide \tglu{}: \tglu{} blocks \gls{ampar} endocytosis, therefore increases synaptic strength, and shifts synaptic plasticity towards \gls{ltp}. We have found that \tglu{} treatment before contextual fear memory training is able to rescue the hyperactivity phenotype found in TgCRND8 mice. Moreover, the rescuing effect is long lasting: during memory testing the treated TgCRND8 mice show normal cell activity level, better information content for behaviour, and also a pattern completion process similar to \gls{wt}. Interestingly, we have found that \tglu{} treated \gls{wt} mice show an earlier pattern completion process, suggesting that effect of \tglu{} may promote \gls{ltp}, and this leads to a strengthening of the memory network, allowing the network pattern to be retrieved with a smaller cellular signal. 

We then investigated whether the memory deficit in TgCRND8 mice is due to impaired memory encoding or impaired memory recall. We trained the mice with contextual fear conditioning, gave the mice a brief reminder with \tglu{} treatment next day, and test the fear memory on the following day. We have found \tglu{} treatment during a brief reminder is able to rescue the fear memory in TgCRND8 mice, while vehicle treated TgCRND8 mice still show the memory deficit. This result suggest that the contextual fear memory is at least encoded one day after training, and the memory deficit can be largely attributed to memory recall deficit. Moreover, we have found that the memory reminder is necessary for the rescuing effect of \tglu{}. This supports our calcium imaging result that the \tglu{} rescues memory recall by strengthening the active memory trace. 

In conclusion, in the project we have developed a miniature fluorescent microscope for calcium imaging in freely behaving mice, and use it to image \gls{ca1} neural activity in \gls{wt} and the mouse model for \gls{ad}, TgCRND8 mice. We have found TgCRND8 mice have contextual fear memory deficit, hyperactive \gls{ca1} neurons, and show less information content about behaviour. We found the memory recalled by TgCRND8 mice is unstable, both at the neural circuit level and behavioural level. \tglu{} treatment which potentially enhance \gls{ltp} can rescue both the circuitry dysfunction and behaviour in the TgCRND8 mice, suggesting the importance of restoring circuitry function in potential treatment in restoring cognitive functions in \gls{ad}.

\section{Future directions for mini-microscope development}
\subsection{Technical improvement for the mini-microscope}

The focus mechanism in the mini-microscope can be improved in the future. In the current project, the focus of our mini-microscope is manually adjusted and fixed during the whole imaging session. This only allows us to image a \SI{400x400x50}{\um} rectangular box \SIrange{50}{150}{\um} below the lens. If the focus can be adjust fast enough during recording, it may be possible to provide a scan across z-axis, and allow recording of more neurons in a 3D volume. In addition, in case of where neurons are heterogeneous across the z-axis such as cortex, a fine-adjustment of focus plane can give the experimenter more control to image specific subpopulation.

One way to improve the focus mechanism is instead of manually turning the camera up and down, the movement can be controlled by a miniature motor. While this can provide a easy auto-focus mechanisms, it will not be fast enough to give z-scan during recording. Moreover, the addition of an extra motor on the mini-microscope can add significant weight, making it too heavy for small rodents such as mice. 

Alternatively, a liquid lens can be used to replace the barrow lens we currently use to focus light to the camera. A liquid lens contains two immiscible liquids, and the curved interface between the two liquid provide the function of a lens. The focus of the liquid lens can be changed by applying voltage across the two liquids, which will bend the meniscus of the two liquids accordingly \citep{kuiper04}. The liquid lens allows focus change in several milliseconds, and is fast enough to provide a real time z-scan with mini-microscope. However, current commercially available liquid lenses are still too large to be implemented on a mini-microscope. Future miniaturized liquid lens can be a great improvement for the mini-microscope.

In the current project, the mini-microscope is connected to the computer through a cable. Although the mini-microscope is compatible with the majority of the behavioural paradigms, the connection cable can make some paradigm hard to perform, especially in environments with overhead structures, or during long-term recording sessions. Efforts can be put to create a wireless version of the mini-microscope. And again, the size and weight of the transmitting circuit and battery can be prohibitive on small rodents. However, recent development have showed that in a resonant cavity, electrical power can be delivered wirelessly using radio frequency and a minimal implant weighing \SI{20}{\mg} \citep{montgomery15}. This can potential provide a way for a wireless power source, and if combined with a minimal transmission circuitry, it is possible to allow wireless long-term calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. This will be very useful for investigating neural circuitry for slower neural circuitry process such as consolidation and circadian rhythm. 

\subsection{Combining mini-microscope with other techniques for investigating circuitry function}

One important future improvement for the construction of the mini-microscope is to combine it with other methods for investigating neural circuitry mechanisms. This will allow cross-referencing the neural activity to other physiological, anatomical and molecular information to provide a whole picture of the function of neural circuits under investigation. 

First, efforts can be put for \textit{post mortem} identification of the field of view from the mini-microscope. This would allow the mini-microscope data to be enriched with those from \gls{ihc} or \gls{fish}, which can potentially provide detailed molecular and cellular information about the neurons, and offer an explanation how subpopulations of neurons with different molecular markers coordinate for circuitry behaviour. 

However in order to reach this goal, the optical property of the mini-microscope has to be accurately characterized. Efforts will need to be put on quantification of the curvature, range, and depth of the field of view. Measurement of these parameters allows mapping the cells identified in the mini-microscope to their original x--y plane, and also give constrains to the position of z-axis. The next step is to construct a 3D image of the \textit{post mortem} tissue, potentially using tissue clearing techniques such as \gls{clarity}. The reconstructed calcium imaging cells can then be mapped to the 3D image of the \textit{post mortem} tissue, allowing further molecular characterization of the recorded neurons. 

Secondly, it is also possible to combine mini-microscope recording with \gls{lfp} measurement for concurrent identification of brain oscillations. This addition does not pose any theoretical challenge, as the \gls{ltp} measurement only involves several extracellular metal electrodes, and \gls{ltp} recording techniques are well established. However to shield potential interference from the camera chip, the \gls{lfp} signals may need to be amplified and digitized on the headset before the signal is transmitted. This may require extra electronic circuitry, and can be challenge for small rodents such as mice, where both the weight and size of the implant are restricted. 

Our investigation of pattern completion in \gls{ad} can greatly benefit from a potential combination of \gls{lfp} and mini-microscope. Since we have found that the network signal, not individual cellular signal, is important in mediating the memory recall deficit, it suggest that the neurons in \gls{ad} are not synchronized to form a pattern. In the hippocampus, oscillations in theta and gamma frequency has been implicated in learning and memory, and hypothesized to provide a reference frame to which neurons can align their activity. Given previous reports that in other mouse model of \gls{ad}, both theta and gamma oscillation are degraded \citep{driver07, villette10, scott12, goutagny13}, it is possible the pattern completion deficit is a consequence of degraded oscillation. And if so, artificially restoring the oscillation by stimulation of the neurons, either electrically or optogenetically, can potentially restore the pattern completion process in the \gls{ad} mice. 


\section{Effect of \tglu{} in strengthening memory trace}

We hypothesized that the \tglu{} rescues the circuitry deficit in \gls{ad} by strengthening of the memory trace, however direct evidence is still required to show that the connection of neurons involved in the contextual fear memory are strengthened after \tglu{} treatment. This hypothesis can be directly tested by combining the mini-microscope recording with two-photon imaging. \citet{carrillo-reid16} have shown that a strong, optogenetically imprinted neural ensembles can be recalled by reactivated by stimulating a single neuron in the ensemble. A similar experiment can be conducted for evaluation of the fear memory ensemble. First, an excitatory opsin can be introduced to the cells of interest. After mini-microscope recording of contextual fear conditioning, the mice can be head-fixed on the stage of two-photon microscope, where the same cells can be imaged through the \gls{grin} lens, and neurons involved in the memory trace can be identified. Part of the memory trace can then be optically stimulated, and if the connections between the fear memory ensemble is strong, a partial activation of the ensemble should be able to activate the rest of the ensemble. Therefore we predict in \tglu{}-treated mice, activation of a smaller part of the ensemble is able to reactivate the whole memory trace. 

\section{pattern completion and pattern separation}

In the current project, we recorded from \gls{ca1}, which is considered an output of the hippocampus circuit, after both pattern separation process in \gls{dg} and pattern completion process in \gls{ca3} \citep{rolls13}. We have only tested the contextual fear memory using the same context, which would primarily involve the pattern completion process. However, it would also be interesting to see, whether the \tglu{} treatment also improves the pattern-separation process. 

If the pattern completion process is enhanced by the \tglu{} treatment without affecting the pattern separation process, it follows that the patterns are likely to complete with a smaller partial activation. This suggest that memory strengthened by \tglu{} treatment is more generalized: since a similar environment may activate part of the trace, and this leads to completion of the fear memory pattern and generates corresponding behaviour. However, this hypothesis is not supported by previous studies. \citet{migues16} gave chronic \tglu{}-treatment in dorsal hippocampus after mice were trained with object recognition, conditioned place preference, or contextual fear conditioning. Interestingly, the authors found \tglu{} treatment not only prevents generalization, but in fact allow the mice to distinguish different memory testing environment more than the vehicle treated group \citep{migues16}. 

\citet{migues16}'s result may not be surprising, given that \tglu{} treatment improves \gls{ltp}, which has also been cardinal for the pattern separation process in \gls{dg} \citep{rolls13}. However, neither \citet{migues16} nor us distinguished \gls{ca3} and \gls{dg} in \tglu{} treatment, and therefore are unable to tease out the effect of \tglu{} on pattern separation and pattern completion separately. A future experiment will be limiting effect of \tglu{} in either \gls{ca3} or \gls{dg}, and observe both the \gls{ca1} activity and the mice's behaviour. We hypothesized that if \tglu{} treatment in \gls{ca3} will result in an enhancement of pattern completion as well as behavioural generalization, and treatment in \gls{dg} will result in an enhance pattern separation and behavioural discrimination. 

A more direct way, but technically more difficult approach is to investigate the involvement of pattern separation process in to use the mini-microscope to image \gls{ca3} and \gls{dg} simultaneously, and observe the pattern completion and pattern separation process directly. This potentially can be done using a doublet \gls{grin} lenses, where a small, thin relay \gls{grin} lens is glued to a large \gls{grin} lens. With proper placement, it allows imaging \gls{ca3} using the rest of the surface of the large \gls{grin} lens, and the thin \gls{grin} lens will be inserted above \gls{dg} to relay image to the large \gls{grin} lens. If combined with connectivity studies, data from this approach allows direct validation of the computational model of hippocampus. Further more in a disease model, having information of both \gls{dg} and \gls{ca3} cell activity as well as their connectivity enables researchers to pin-point the functional impairment in the hippocampus circuitry.

\section{Effect of \tglu{} in correcting \gls{ad} pathology, potential treatment target}

In the current project, we have shown that the \tglu{} treatment is not only able to rescue the behavioural deficit of the TgCRND8 mice, but also able to rescue circuitry function in these mice. Given that the aberrant circuitry activity in \gls{ad} promotes \gls{ad} pathology, it is worth investigate whether \tglu{}, and its target of \gls{ampar} endocytosis process, can be targeted to alleviate the \gls{ad} pathology. Results from \citet{dong15} show that chronically \tglu{}-treated \gls{ad} mice have fewer number of amyloid plaques compared to vehicle treated mice after memory training. However, it is still unknown whether \tglu{} treatment can lead to reverse of the \gls{ad} pathology. Instead of comparing to vehicle-treated controls, chronically treated \gls{ad} mice can be longitudinally compared to mice before treatment to characterize the effect of \tglu{} on \gls{ad} progression.

In addition with the mini-microscope, it may be possible to chronically image both the neural activity change during the chronic treatment of \tglu{}, as well as simultaneous imaging of the amyloid plaques \citep{zhang15}. Data from such experiments can provide details of how plaques deposition affects circuitry activity, as well as conversely, how circuitry activity can affect \gls{ad} progression. Moreover, \tglu{}, being an interference peptide, is not a good candidate for drug treatment because of the chemical instability, short half life, and not being applicable orally \citep{fosgerau15}. Future studies can also focus on small molecules having the same circuitry effect of \tglu{} with better pharmacological properties.

In conclusion, the aim the current project is two-fold: 
\begin{enumerate*}[label={\alph*)}, font={\bfseries}]
    \item improve the current tools available for neuroscientists to investigate of neural circuitry mechanisms, and
    \item contribute to the understanding of circuitry mechanisms underlying the cognitive deficit in \gls{ad}.
\end{enumerate*}
In the end, I hope through this thesis, I help to provide a potential link between studies at cellular level and behaviour level, and contribute to the understanding, and potential treatment of \gls{ad}. In the future, I predict advances in neural recording technology will reveal detailed mechanism of neural circuitry, and inspire novel treatment for neurological disorders such as \gls{ad}.
