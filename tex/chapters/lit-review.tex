\section{Clinical Presentation of \gls{ad}}
\subsection{Prevalence}
It is estimated that 35.6 million people has dementia worldwide, costing more than US\$ 604 billion each year, and create heavy burden to their family members and caregivers \citep{who13}. \gls{ad} is the most common form of dementia, contributes to \SI{60}{\percent} -- \SI{80}{\percent} of the cases \citep{ad16}. It is estimated to affect \SI{11}{\percent} of population at age 65 and older in the North America, and the risk triples to \SI{33}{\percent} for individuals beyond 85 \citep{hebert13}. The real number of patients affected by \gls{ad} is much larger, as instances of \gls{ad} are often under-diagnosed and under-reported \citep{barrett06, zaleta12}. While the rate of \gls{ad} in population beyond 65 is stable over years, however as the population ages, the burden of \gls{ad} is expect to continue to rise in the future. It is estimated the instances of \gls{ad} will double every 20 years \citep{who13, hebert13}. This will translates to more than 8 million instances in the United States in 2030, and as many as 16 million in 2050. \gls{who} estimated in 2040, cases of dementia worldwide will reach 81.1 million, most of which are contributed by \gls{ad} \citep{who13}. 

\subsection{Progression}
\gls{ad} is characterized by progressive decline of memory, learning ability and other cognitive functions. \gls{ad} starts before clinical symptoms appear \citep{hubbard90}, \citep{dubois16}. \citep{pandya16} \citep{reiman16}

In the early stage of \gls{ad}



\subsection{intervention}
the drugs: donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, mementine
other: clearing amyloid plagues
immunotherapy
preclinical: \citep{malek-ahmadi16} \citep{reiman16}
