\section{Clinical presentation of \gls{ad}}
\subsection{Prevalence}
It is estimated that 35.6 million people has dementia worldwide, costing more than US\$ 604 billion each year, and create heavy burden to their family members and caregivers \citep{who13}. \gls{ad} is the most common form of dementia, contributes to \SI{60}{\percent} -- \SI{80}{\percent} of the cases \citep{ad16}. It is estimated to affect \SI{11}{\percent} of population at age 65 and older in the North America, and the risk triples to \SI{33}{\percent} for individuals beyond 85 \citep{hebert13}. The real number of patients affected by \gls{ad} is much larger, as instances of \gls{ad} are often under-diagnosed and under-reported \citep{barrett06, zaleta12}. While the rate of \gls{ad} in population beyond 65 is stable over years, however as the population ages, the burden of \gls{ad} is expect to continue to rise in the future. It is estimated the instances of \gls{ad} will double every 20 years \citep{who13, hebert13}. This will translates to more than 8 million instances in the United States in 2030, and as many as 16 million in 2050. \gls{who} estimated in 2040, cases of dementia worldwide will reach 81.1 million, most of which are contributed by \gls{ad} \citep{who13}. 

\subsection{Progression}
\subsubsection{History}
The \gls{ad} is named after Alois Alzheimer, who described the disease in 1906 \citep{goedert06}. One of his patients, Auguste D., was admitted with progressive memory loss, hallucinations and focal symptoms. After her death, Dr. Alzheimer examined her post-mortem brain tissue with silver staining, and made the crucial observation of plaques and \glspl{nft}, which become the definitive biomarkers of \gls{ad} \citep{goedert06, dubois16}. \gls{ad} is characterized by progressive decline of memory, learning ability and other cognitive functions. Post-mortem examination of patient's brain is characterized with amyloid plagues, \glspl{nft} and significant loss of neural tissue.

\subsubsection{Preclinical stage}

It is now known the biology of \gls{ad} starts well before clinical symptoms appear \citep{dubois16}.  Neural tissue loss can be detected by \gls{mri} before the onset of \gls{ad} \citep{jack92, scheltens92, chetelat03}, and changes in brain structure from \gls{mri} imaging can predict whether aging participants with \gls{mci} will develop \gls{ad} \citep{jack99}. Moreover, \gls{pet} imaging agents which binds to amyloid plaques have been developed in 2003 \citep{mathis03}, and more recently, \atau tracers have also been discovered \citep{maruyama13, okamura13}. These radiopharmaceuticals allows \textit{in vivo} imaging of amyloid plaques and \atau tangles, and the results consensually show that presence of plaque deposition and \atau tangles predicts \gls{ad} risk in \gls{mci} or asymptomatic participants \citep{klunk04, chien14, sepulcre16}.

Another line of evidence for preclinical \gls{ad} comes from biomarkers detectable from \gls{csf}. As \gls{csf} is circulating extra-cellular space in the brain, its molecular composition reflects that of the \gls{cns}. Core biomarkers such as \abeta\tsb{42}, \atau and hyperphosphorylated \atau are directly related to \gls{ad}, and their levels in \gls{csf} has been consistently shown to differentiate \gls{ad} from other aging-related cognitive disorders \citep{blennow10}. Moreover, longitudinal studies of \gls{csf} biomarker levels in families with autosomal-dominant \gls{ad}, where the participants have a predictable age of \gls{ad} onset, have shown detectable changes of \abeta\tsb{42} and \atau concentrations in \gls{csf} 15--20 years before symptom onset \citep{bateman12, fagan14}. Studies in asymptomatic and \gls{mci} patients have shown a similar timeline, where the biomarker changes are detectable 5--10 years before \gls{ad} symptoms onset \citep{buchhave12, vos13}. 
\todo{MCI?} 

In conclusion, research in preclinical \gls{ad} suggest that the pathology of \gls{ad} exists as a continuum. In response to recent research result, biomarker evidence has been proposed to be included to increase accuracy of diagnosis, together with the recognition of preclinical \gls{ad} stage \citep{ad16}. Recognizing \gls{ad} before the onset of clinical symptoms also provides an optimal window for early intervention and optimization of treatment. 

\subsubsection{Clinical stage}
As a result of the broad clinical \gls{ad} pathology spectrum, the diagnosis procedure for living humans is complex. The current \gls{ad} diagnosis recommendation from the \gls{niaaa} requires the patient to meet the diagnosis of dementia, where the patient need to show cognitive or behaviour decline that:
\begin{enumerate*}[label={\alph*)}, font={\bfseries}]
    \item disables usual activity or work, 
    \item reported both from personal history and an objective cognitive assessment, and
    \item cannot explained by other major mental disorder.
\end{enumerate*} \citep{mckhann11}.
Diagnosis of \gls{ad} is further split into 3 categories, probable \gls{ad}dementia, possible \gls{ad} dementia and probable \gls{ad} dementia with evidence of the \gls{ad} pathophysiological process. To meet the probable \gls{ad} dementia, the cognitive decline from the patients needs to be gradual over months and years, and the initial symptoms needs to be a deterioration of memory, language, visuospatial or execution function. In possible \gls{ad} dementia, the patients may have a sudden onset or mixed aetiological origin of the symptoms compared to probable dementia category. The last category incorporates biomarker evidence in the diagnosis of \gls{ad}, which can increase the confidence that the symptoms from probable \gls{ad} dememtia is a result of \gls{ad} pathophysiological process \citep{mckhann11}. However a definitive diagnosis of \gls{ad} can only be obtained post-mortem, where the brain tissue is immunohistochemically stained against \abeta, \atau for \gls{ad} pathophysiology, and neuritic plaques for neuronal damage. A diagnosis of \gls{ad} requires significant presence of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaques in various brain regions related to memory, language and other cognitive functions \citep{hyman12}.

Clinical assessment of \gls{ad} progression can be accomplished using \gls{gds} scales \citep{reisberg82} and \gls{fast} \citep{sclan92}. \gls{ad} patients generally begins with decline of memory, language, and spatial navigation performace. The symptoms then progress to difficulties in routine tasks, change in emotion and personality, and disturbance in diurnal rhythms. In the end, the patient shows completely loss of verbal ability, problems in toileting and eating, as well as psychomotor problems, and require full time assistance to survive \citep{reisberg82, sclan92}.

While the stage of \gls{ad} is consistent, the rate of progression is highly variable from patient to patient \citep{komarova11, tschanz11}. This suggests that \gls{ad} patients are a heterogeneous population, and the progression of \gls{ad} may under influence of various latent factors. This is systemetically investigated in the Cache County Study on Memory in Aging, where a population of \num{5000} eldly residents in Cache County, Utah, USA are followed for up to \num{12} years, and most of the participants are followed until their deaths. The study has found several factors that are predictive of rate of cognitive decline in \gls{ad}. Cardiovascular disease history predicts a faster rate of decline \citep{mielke07}, and better general health predicts otherwise \citep{leoutsakos12}. Moreover, aspects of the caregiving environment is also influential for the decline rate of congitive functions in \gls{ad} patients. For example, \gls{ad} patients will benefit from more engagement in cognitive stimulating activities \citep{treiber11} as well as a closer relationship to the caregiver \citep{norton09}.

As \gls{ad} is a progressive disorder with no effective treatment, the prognosis for an \gls{ad} patient is not bright. The average survival duration after diagnosis is 4--8 years \citep{larson04, helzner08}. Moreover, patients will spend \SI{40}{\percent} of the time after diagnosis with the most severe stage of \gls{ad} \citep{arrighi10}. Given the prevalence of \gls{ad} and amount of burden it creates, delaying the progression of \gls{ad} by only months can reduce more than \$\num{2000} per year even if no effective treatment is available \citep{zhu06}. This will translate to more than \$15 billion total reduction of cost over the a decade in Canada \citep{adc10}.

\subsection{intervention}
\subsubsection{drug treatment \label{treatment}}
Currently only four drugs are approved for \gls{ad}: three \gls{ache} inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine, and one \gls{nmdar} antagonist memantine \citep{nelson15}. Rivastigmine and galantamine are approved for treatment of mild-moderate \gls{ad}, and donepezil is available for \gls{ad} patients at all stages \citep{bassil09, smith09}. Among these, memantine is only available to moderate-severe \gls{ad} patients, used either by itself or combined with donepezil \citep{nelson15}.

\Gls{ache} inhibitors aims to increase amount of \gls{ach} concentration, which has been found depleted in the \gls{ad} brain (discussed in \ref{ach-hypo}). The \gls{ache} inhibitors act by blocking the \gls{ache}, and therefore inhibits the reuptake of \gls{ach} in the synapse, allowing its concentration to increase. \Gls{ache} inhibitors are effective on the cognitive function of the \gls{ad} patients. For mild-moderate \gls{ad} patients, large-scale double-blind studies have found significant cognitive protection effects with donepezil \citep{rogers98}, rivastigmine \citep{farlow00}, and galantamine treatment \citep{wilkinson01}. A more recent meta-analysis of double-blind studies has confirmed the effectiveness of \gls{ache} inhibitors on the cognitive outcome in mild-moderate \gls{ad} patients, and found no difference in the effectiveness between \gls{ache} inhibitors at their prescription dose \citep{tan14}.

While the effect of \gls{ache} inhibitors is consistent, it however only provides a small improvement of the cognitive function in \gls{ad} patients, which is not likely to be clinical meaningful on individual patients \citep{lin13}. Moreover, not all patients respond to \gls{ache} inhibitor treatment, and the factors influnecing drug responsiveness is still unknown \citep{vanderputt06}. The \gls{ache} inhibitors unfortunately also lose their effectiveness as the patient progresses beyond moderate stage \citep{gillette-guyonnet11}, except donezepil, which has been found at high dose mildly effective in moderate-severe \gls{ad} patients \citep{sabbagh13}. 

Memantine aims to protect neurons from excitotoxicity acting on \gls{nmdar}. \Gls{nmdar} are calcium-permeable glutamate receptors which is central for learning and memory. The \Gls{nmdar} is blocked by a \ce{Mg^2+} ion in a voltage-dependent manner. In \gls{ad}, the \ce{Mg^2+} block is compromised by \abeta accumulation, leading to a pathological influx of \ce{Ca^2+} into the post-synaptic neuron, and eventually cell death \citep{danysz12}. Memantine replaces the \ce{Mg^2+} and blocks the \gls{nmdar} in a \abeta-independent manner, therefore prevents the pathological influx of \ce{Ca^2+}. Moreover, as the memantine block of \gls{nmdar} is also voltage dependent, it still allows physiological \ce{Ca^2+} influx for learning and memory \citep{danysz12}.

Memantine only have a significant effect in moderate-severe \gls{ad} patients \citep{reisberg03, tariot04, schneider11}, and often prescribed with \gls{ache} inhibitor for a positive additive effect \citep{rountree09}. Double blind studies have shown memantine is able to improve cognitive function in moderate-severe \gls{ad} patients \citep{reisberg03, tariot04}, although the improvement is not consistent \citep{porsteinsson08}. 

In conclusion, the currently approved treatments of \gls{ad} are only able to provide relief on the cognitive symptoms of \gls{ad}, and the effectiveness of the drug varies from patient to patient. None of the drugs has effect on \gls{ad}-related behaviour symptoms, or show any improvement for the general function of the \gls{ad} patients \citep{tan14}. The drugs are, at best, able to delay the progression of \gls{ad}, but unable to alter the course or improve the outcome of the disease. Together with a high drop-off rate and reports of adverse effect in many randomized clinical trials, the role of currently available drugs is still under debate \citep{bond12}.

\section{neuropathology in \gls{ad}}
\subsection{Introduction}
An effective intervention for \gls{ad} will be much easier to find if the aetiology of \gls{ad} is known. The most direct, and acceptable cause of \gls{ad} symptoms is synapse and neuronal loss, which is the best pathological correlate of the progression of the \gls{ad} symptoms, and has been a focus of clinical investigation for over a decade \citep{selkoe02, coleman04}. 

Unfortunately given the progressive nature of \gls{ad}, rescuing synaptic and neuronal loss is not effective without knowing its upstream pathological cause. In this section, I will discuss the cholinergic hypothesis which leads to most of the currently available pharmaceutical \gls{ad} treatments, as well as the amyloid and tau hypothesis, which hypothesize the hallmarks of \gls{ad}, amyloid plaques and \glspl{nft}, are core of the \gls{ad} aetiology. 

It should be noted that although not discussed, there are many other hypotheses for aetiology of late-onset \gls{ad} supported by empirical evidence, and has gain various attention over the years. The glutamate hypothesis, which is the basis for the memantine treatment (Section \ref{treatment}), suggests that the neuronal death is a result of excess glutamate activity, which leads to a toxic overload of \ce{Ca^2+} in the neurons which initiates neuronal death \citep{greenamyre88, parsons07}. The oxidative stress hypothesis proposes that heavy metal ions and other molecules accumulates in the \gls{ad} brain, and induces the generation of free radicals, which causes neuronal damage either directly or indirectly \citep{markesbery97, smith10}. 

A group of hypotheses proposes the symptoms of \gls{ad} is a result of abnoraml metabolism in the neurons or insufficient energy supply to the neurons. The mitochondria hypothesis suggests \gls{ad} is caused by a decreased mitochondria function which leads to insufficient energy in the cell \citep{zhu06a, swerdlow14}. The vascular hypothesis suggest that in \gls{ad}, blood vessels in the brain constricts and hardens, therefore unable to provide the brain with sufficient energy \citep{luchsinger05, mamelak17}. The inflammatory hypothesis proposes that chronic inflammation leads to \gls{ad}. An chronic elevated inflammatory response impairs metabolic balance of the neurons, which leads to pathological changes in the axons, then plaque deposition and tangle formation \citep{krstic13}. 

Here each of the hypothesis for \gls{ad} aetiology is presented as separate, linear sequences of causes and effects, however there are significant overlap between them. Moreover, given the heterogeneity of late-onset \gls{ad} patients \citep{komarova11, tschanz11}, it is unlikely that there is a single cause for \gls{ad}. In fact, the aetiology of the \gls{ad} patients is often mixed \citep{schneider07}. The readers are reminded here the grouping of \gls{ad} aetiology into multiple hypothesis is artificial, and in reality a patients can show multiple aetiology simutaneously, and the symptoms can be a result of interactions between them. 

\subsection{Cholinergic hypothesis\label{ach-hypo}}
First proposed in \citeyear{bartus82} by \citeauthor{bartus82}, the cholinergic hypothesis the oldest theory explaining the aetiology of the \gls{ad}. \citeauthor{bartus82} proposed that the cognitive symptoms of \gls{ad} is a result of impairments in the cholinergic system function. This claim is based on  the importance of cholinergic system in learning and memory \citep{deutsch71}. Moreover, it has been found young experimental participants with scopolamine, a nicotinic \gls{ach} receptor antagonist, shows impaired memory performance at the same level of elderly participants. This impairment can be rescued by \gls{ach} agonist such as physostigmine \citep{drachman74}. Together with the evidence that cholinergic synapses in \gls{ad} undergo profound degeneration \citep{whitehouse82}, these results led to the proposal of the cholinergic hypothesis, and development of the \gls{ache} inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine, the only three drugs available to mild-moderate \gls{ad} patients \citep[][; also see Section \ref{treatment}]{bartus00}. 

The cholinergic hypothesis received mixed support after its publication, at which time details of the cholinergic projections are studied in the context of \gls{ad}. It has been found in \gls{ad}, cholinergic neurons have impaired synthesis pathway for \gls{ach} \citep{milner87}. \gls{ad} is also found to correlate with a decrease of nicotinic \gls{ach} receptor density, however the muscarinic \gls{ach} receptors are not affected \citep{nordberg92, burghaus00}. Moreover, the degeneration of cholinergic synapses is most prominent in areas involved in learning and memory \citep{geula96}. 

While the cholinergic hypothesis is supported by these evidence, it is however also challenged, primarily by an absent of evidence on early development of \gls{ad}. For example, degeneration of cholinergic neurons is only found in late-stage \gls{ad}, but not present in preclinical and early-stage patients \citep{davis99}, and cholinergic neurons in hippocampus and frontal cortex is found increased in early \gls{ad} patients \citep{dekosky02}. Moreover, the limited effect of \gls{ache} inhibitors on treating \gls{ad} suggests that the cholinergic degeneration may be a secondary effect. This has generated significant doubt on the role of cholinergic system in \gls{ad} aetiology and the popularity of cholinergic hypothesis has declined. The cholinergic hypothesis is now often viewed as either a effect of amyloid cascade (Discussed in Section \ref{amy-hypo}), or a cofactor for other risk factors for neuronal degeneration \citep{roberson97, contestabile11}.


\subsection{Amyloid cascade hypothesis\label{amy-hypo}}
The amyloid cascade hypothesis, first proposed by \citeauthor{hardy92} in \citeyear{hardy92}, states that abnormal accumumulation of the protein \abeta is a primary trigger for the \gls{ad}. Accumulation of \abeta initiates a series of pathological events in the brain, including tangle formation, neuritic injury, and finally dysfunction and death of neurons. This claim is based on the discovery that the ``senial plaques'', which characterized the \gls{ad}, is composed of \abeta \citep{masters85}. \abeta is the result of sequential cleavage of the \gls{app} on chromosome 21. In the Down syndrome patients, \gls{app} is over-expressed, and all Down syndrome patients have early onset of \gls{ad} like neural pathology, including amyloid plaque and \gls{nft} formation\citep{wisniewski85, hardy02}. Moreover, the findings that mutation in the \gls{app} (Dutch type) causes cerebral hemorrhage and deposition of \abeta further supports a causal role of \gls{app} in \abeta accumulation.

Genetic and molecular studies after the original discovery have described how \abeta is processed from \gls{app} in detail. \gls{app} can be processed in two pathways: a amyloidgenic pathway and a non-amyloidgenic pathway. In the non-amyloidgenic pathway, \gls{app} is cleaved by \textalpha-secretase into a soluble N-terminal fragment s\gls{app}\textalpha, and a 83-amino-acid C-terminal peptide, C83. The C83 is then cleaved by \textgamma-secretase into a small p3 peptide and the \gls{aicd}. However in the amyloidgenic pathway, the \gls{app} is first processed by \textbeta-secretase into N-terminal fragment s\gls{app}\textbeta, and a 99-amino-acid C-terminal peptide, C99. The C99 is then cleaved by \textgamma-secretase to form a extracellular peptide containing 38-43 amino acids, \abeta and the \gls{aicd} \citep{barage15}. The most toxic forms of \abeta are \abeta[40] and \abeta[42]. While \abeta[40] is more abundent, \abeta[42] is more hydrophobic and aggregates faster \citep{walsh07}. 

Evidence from animal models and \gls{fad} supports a causal role of \abeta in \gls{ad} symptoms. Autosomal dominent mutations in genes encoding the \textgamma-secretase (\textit{PSEN1} and \textit{PSEN2}) renders the non-amyloidgenic pathway for \gls{app} processing defective, allowing more \abeta production through the amyloidgenic pathway, resulting in many instances of \gls{fad} \citep{suzuki94, levy-lahad95, rogaev95}. The effect of mutation in \gls{fad} is also confirmed in mouse models where the mutant human genes found in \gls{fad} is expressed. These mouse models develop amyloid plaques in the brain, together with learning and memory deficits \citep{hsiao96, dodart99, chishti01, westerman02}. Moreover, acute treatment of \gls{abeta} is toxic to hippocampal and neocortical neurons, both in cultured cells and \textit{in vivo} \citep{lacor04, shankar08}. In addition to these evidence, genome-wide association studies have found regions associated with increased \abeta levels \citep{kehoe99, myers00}.

However, there is more evidence suggesting the aetiology of \gls{ad}, especilally late-onset \gls{ad}, is more complicated than stated by amyloid cascade hypothesis. Longitudinal \gls{pet} studies have shown that while amyloid plaque load in humans poses a significant risk of cognitive decline in both cognitively normal and \gls{mci} subjects, it is only weakly associated with cognition, and not predictive of the disease progression in \gls{ad} patients \citep{chen14}. Moreover, amyloid plaque prevalence in elderly subjects is more than twice of \gls{ad} prevalence \citep{rowe10, ad16}, suggesting a large population carrying significant plaque load, yet the cognition is unaffected. On the other hand, recent clinical trials aiming to remove plaques from \gls{ad} patients using immunotherapy shows success in reducing the plaque load, however unable to prevent the cognitive decline of the patients \citep{farlow15, siemers16, sevigny16}. These results suggest that the amyloid palque load does not correlate with the progression of \gls{ad} or the cognitive symptoms, and the role of \abeta in the development of \gls{ad} is more nuanced. 

In light of the negative evidence, amendament to the amyloid cascade hypothesis is proposed to explain the missing relationship between amyloid plaques and cognitive performance. Given the consistent evidence of \abeta toxicity on synapse and neurons\citep{ferreira15}, and that synaptic degeneration correlates with the cognitive decline in \gls{ad} \citep{selkoe02, coleman04}, it has been proposed that the soluble fractionof \abeta oligomers, which is most toxic to neurons, are cardinal to \gls{ad} and insoluable plaques are irrelavent \citep{ferreira15}. Moreover, \citet{canter16} proposed \abeta destabilizes synapses and impairs normal function of neural networks, and its this destructive effect creates the cognitive symptoms of \gls{ad}. Evidence for this hypothesis is descussed in Section \ref{network-hypo}. In conclusion, the amyloid cascade hypothesis is supported by the most compelling evidence to date, the reality of \gls{ad} aetiology is more complex than what the hypothesis suggested.

\subsection{Tau hypothesis}

The \atau hypothesis is based on the findings that the other neural pathological signature of \gls{ad}, the \glspl{nft}, are composed of the hyperphosphorylated \atau proteins \citep{grundke-iqbal86}. It is therefore hypothesized that abnormal functions of the \atau proteins leads to a series of pathological events which is responsible for neurodegeneration and symptoms of the \gls{ad} \citep{goedert11}.

In physiological conditions, the \atau proteins, expressed by the \gls{mapt} gene, are widely expressed in the brain. In physiological conditions, the \atau proteins assemble and stabilize microtubules in the cells, which is important for maintaining cell structure and intracellular transport. However, in \gls{ad}, \atau is found hyperphosphorylated by multiple kinases, including \gls{gsk3}, \gls{cdk5} and \gls{mapk} \citep{singh94}. The hyperphosphorylated \atau is unable to bind to the microtubule building block, tubulin, and therefore hypothesized to cause the destabilization of microtubules \citep{bramblett93, yoshida93, alonso94}. The unbound \atau proteins under high concentrations, are likely to aggregate and sebsequently from twisted paired helical filaments, which are the main component of the \glspl{nft} \citep{kidd63, kuret05}. Destabilized microtubules and the toxicity of the \glspl{nft} will lead to failure in axonal transportation of vesicles and mitochondria, and finally the death of the neuron.

In \gls{ad}, the presence of \glspl{nft} is significantly correlated with the cognitive deficits of the patients \citep{hyman12}. Moreover, the spread of \atau pathology also follows the progression of \gls{ad} symptoms, first affecting brain regions important for learning and memory, such as hippocampus and amygdala, then spread out to neocortex \citep{braak91}. These earlier results from post-mortem studies are confirmed by recent \gls{pet} studies using \atau tracers, where the amount and distribution of the \atau protein in the brain can be measured \textit{in vivo} \citep{ossenkoppele16, scholl16}. These results suggest the importance of \atau pathology in the development of \gls{ad}.

Despite the correlation with cognitive symptoms of \gls{ad}, \atau pathology is now considered secondary to the cause of \gls{ad}. This claim is first supported by the discovery that mutation in the MAPT gene, which encodes the \atau protein, causes a familial form of frontaltemporal dementia \citep{hutton98, poorkaj98}. Moreover, \atau pathology has been implicated in many other neurodegenerative disorders \citep[e.g.][]{williams09, mckee16}. These evidence suggest that \atau pathology is sufficient for causing neurodegeneration. However, as there is no amyloid plaque formation in these disorders or mouse model of \atau pathology \citep{gotz04}, it is unlikely to be the primary cause for \gls{ad}.

There is also evidence suggesting \atau pathology may be downstream of the amyloid cascade. It has been found in \gls{ad}, plaque formation preceeds tangle formation \citep{price99}, and \abeta binds to the \atau protein \textit{in vitro}, and accelarates \atau hyperphosphorylation \citep{guo06, zempel10}. In mouse models of \atau pathology, \abeta accelerates \gls{nft} formation and neural degeneration \citep{lewis01, terwel08}. These evidence further supports the amyloid cascade hypothesis. 

In conclusion, evidence suggest \atau pathology is secondary to the cause of \gls{ad}. However given its strong correlation with the cognitive deficits in \gls{ad} and important role in neurodegeneration, lots of efforts are still put to understand mechanism underlies it. 

\section{Hippocampus and memory}
\subsection{History}
The hippocampus went into the spotlight of learning and memory research after the report of the famous patient, \gls{hm} \citep{scoville57, squire09}. \Gls{hm} received bilateral resection of the medial temporal lobe, including hippocampus and brain areas surrounding it. While the surgery cured the eplespy \gls{hm} had, it creates profound anterograde amnesia, to the point that \gls{hm} forgots daily events minutes after \citep{scoville57, squire09}. This was unexpected at that time, mostly due to earlier work of Karl Lashley which shows memory is not stored in a localized fashion \citep{bruce01}. Further studies of \gls{hm}'s memory deficit and animal models of hippocampus lesion have suggested that hippocampus is important for governing the formation of long-term memories, which form the basis for \citet{squire91}'s theory of hippocampal function (discussed in Section \ref{hpc-squire}).

Another break through in understanding hippocampus function starts from the discovery of place cells \citep{o'keefe71}. \citet{o'keefe71} recorded single unit signals from \gls{ca1} and \gls{ca3} subregions of hippocampus in rats, and found cells that fires only when the rat is in a specific location of the environment. The discovery forms the basis for the cognitive mapping theory \citep{o'keefe76}, and has inspired further research that confirms the important role of hippocampus and surrounding areas in processing location-related information (discussed in Section \ref{hpc-spatial}.


\subsection{Anatomy of hippocampus}
The anatomy and cellular structure of hippocampus is first described by \citet{cajal93}, and more recently \citet{strien09} has reviewed the anatomy of hippocampus in detail. While the anatomy described here is mostly based on rodent studies, that the organization, connectivity and function of the hippocampus are very similar across mice, rats, monkeys and humans \citep{clark13}. 

Hippocampus is a large brain area in the medial temporal cortex consisting of multiple subregions, \gls{dg}, \gls{ca1}, \gls{ca2}, \gls{ca3} and subiculum. While original studies regarded hippocampus as a single brain region, it is now recognized the hippocampus is heterogeneous along the dorsal-ventral axis \citep{moser98, fanselow10}. The dorsal hippocampus (septal pole) have strong connections to cingulate and retrosplenial cortex as well as thalamus, and are found important for cognition and spatial navigation. The ventral hippocampus (temporal pole), as well as the subregion \gls{ca2}, preferentially connect to regions such as hypothalamus and amygdala, and have been implicated in emotion and stress regulation \citep{fanselow10, chevaleyre16}. In this thesis, the discussion will be limited to \gls{dh}, as it is the focus of all of the experiments.

The standard view regards the hippocampus as a tri-synaptic loop \citep{strien09}. The \gls{ec} collects multimodal sensory information and sends from layer II to \gls{dg} and \gls{ca3} through axons called perforant path. Axons from granular cells in \gls{dg}, called mossy fibers, then synapse onto \gls{ca3}. Pyramidal cells in \gls{ca3} then projects to ipsilateral \gls{ca1} through axons called Schaffer colaterals, and to contralateral \gls{ca1} through commissural pathway. \gls{ca1} pyramidal cells in turn synapses on the deep layer of \gls{ec} either directly or through subiculum \citep{strien09}.

While the standard view of hippocampus connectivity is unidirectional, there are also significant recurrent projections and back projections in hippocampus. The subregion \gls{ca3} is well known to have recurrent connections, and this recurrent connection is proposed to be critical for encoding and retreving episodic memories \citep{rolls07, nakazawa02}. Weaker recurrent connections in \gls{ca1} and \gls{dg} is also reported \citep{swanson81, ishizuka90, buckmaster93}. Moreover outside the standard view, there are also back projections from \gls{ca3} back to \gls{dg}, as well as back projections from \gls{ca1} to \gls{ca3} \citep{swanson81, li94}. Back projections from subiculum to \gls{ca1} is also reported \citep{finch83}. 



\subsection{Theories of hippocampus function}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
While it has been established that hippocampus plays a cardinal role in learning and memory, the exact role of hippocampus, and the mechanism hippocampus enables these cognitive processes, are still unclear. Many theories have been proposed to answer these questions, and some of the most prominent theories are discussed here. I will start with the earlier Marr model \citep{marr71} which have been hugely influential to later theoretical development of understanding hippocampal function. The episodic theory (which is also known as the standard model of hippocampus), and its later extension, multiple trace theory, are mostly influnced by the studies of the famous patient \gls{hm}, who received bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions and displayed anterograde amnesia and other cognitive symptoms. The cognitive mapping theory and its extension, relational theory, stems from the discovery of place cells in hippocampus \citep{o'keefe71}. 

The readers are also reminded that these theories should be regarded as multiple facets, instead of competing hypothesis, of hippocampal functions. There are significant overlap between the theories, and each theory only aim to provide a perspective of hippocampal function. In light of this, more recently effort has been put for unification of many of theories, and each of the theories continuously receive support or challenge from emerging experimental evidence.


\subsubsection{Marr Model}
In his seminal paper, \citet{marr71} first used mathematical term to describe the kind of computation hippocampus does. He proposed that the neocortex, being a complex structure, must have performed a complex computation task, while the archicortex, with a simpler structure, must have a simpler computational function. In terms of memory function, and based on the symptoms of patient \gls{hm}, he proposed that the role of hippocampus is to provide short-term storage for ``simple memories'', where the sensory inputs are stored with minimal modification. The representation of ``simple memories'' are then transferred to neocortex, in a process where statistical regularities of the ``simple memories'' are extracted, and stored in the neocortex to form long-term memory. 

In his model, \citet{marr71} has also described how hippocampus stores ``simple memories''. He argues this task can be completed with a three-layer neural network: an input layer, a codon layer and an output layer. The input layer represents the sensory pattern. The patterns are then encoded with the codon layer, which have a larger number of nodes with sparse activity in order to store patterns reliably. He also proposed that the output layer should have a recurrent connection, which will allow the system to reconstruct a pattern with only a partial input pattern. 

The Marr model is remarkable even viewed from now. While in the original paper Marr \citep{marr71} regarded the neucortex, entorhinal cortex and the whole hippocampus as the input, codon and output layer respectively, under modern interpretation the entorhinal cortex is better fit as the input layer, \gls{dg} as the codon layer and both \gls{ca3} and \gls{ca1} as the output layer \citep{willshaw15}. Not only does the large number of sparsely active granular cells in \gls{dg} and the recurrent connections in \gls{ca3}, fits the anatomy described in \citet{marr71}'s model, the function of \gls{dg} and \gls{ca3} is also congruent with the model. For example, \gls{dg} has been shown to perform pattern separation, and the \gls{ca3} is shown to perform pattern completion through its recurrent connections (discussed in Section \ref{pattern}).  Moreover, the idea of dissociate the memory system into a fast, simple system and a slow, complex system also forms the basis of the modern theory of system memory consolidation \citep{squire92, mcclelland13}. 

However, the \citet{marr71} model is unfortunately limited the data available at its time. The discovery of place cells \citep{o'keefe71} other specialized position-related cells in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus such as grid cells and head-direction cells \citep{taube90, fyhn04, hafting05}, suggest hippocampus processes context information (discussed in \ref{hpc-spatial}), and is not a mere pattern store. Modern theoretical development has also shown that \citet{marr71}'s proporsition of an overnight transfer from the fast system to the slow system is overly simplified \todo{cite system consolidation}. 

In conclusion, while \citet{marr71}'s model is sometimes titled as a ``noble failure'' \citep{willshaw15}, the model and its ideas have inspired modern theoretical development and still exerts a strong influence on the learning and memory literature today. 




\subsubsection{Standard model of memory \label{hpc-squire}}
The standard model of memory extends the Marr model to take account of studies of medial temporal lobe lesion in human and animals, as well as neural imaging studies of hippocampal and cortical activity after memory encoding \citep{squire92, squire09}. First of all, it has been found that in humans with \gls{mtl} lesion, anterograde amnesia does not affect all forms of memory. Declarative memory, which includes the ability to remember facts and events, are impaired by \gls{mtl} lesion, while non-declarative memory, which encompasses learning skills and habits, are spared \citep{cohen80, squire04}. This result suggests multiple memory systems exist, and \gls{mtl} is only necessary for the formation declarative memeory. Moreover, it was also found that while \gls{mtl} lesion patients such as \gls{hm} suffer from anterograde amnesia, they also display a temporal graded retrograde amnesia, as they are unable to recall events years before the lesion, but are able to recall older memories \citep{marslen-wilson75}. This result suggest that \gls{mtl} does not disengage once the memory forms, but perform an important role in a slow memory consolidation process, where memories are transformed into a more robust form and become resistent to disruption \citep{squire92}. 

As a result, \citet{squire92} proposes that for declarative memories, hippocampus (and its surrounding regions in \gls{mtl}) serve as a fast system to quickly encode the memory. Then over a period of time, hippocampus will active engage cortical regions in the process of memory consolidation, which allow a representation of the memory to gradually form in the neocortex and in the end independent of hippocampus activity. This model is now known as the standard model of memory. 

The standard model received a wide range of support from animal studies \citep{squire09}. First of all, the temporally graded role of hippocampus in memory formation has been consistently shown in rodents and monkeys, as shown by more than 30 studies compiled by \citet{frankland05} with a variety of lesion techniques and memory tests. Moreover, studies tracking the activity and structural change of hippocampus have supported the prediction that hippocampus will gradually disengage after initial memory encoding. For example, it has been found that over time after memory encoding, hippocampus shows gradually decreased activity and the cortex show increased activity \citep[e.g.][]{bontempi99, frankland04, takehara-nishiuchi06}, as well as a similar gradient of neuronal structural change \citep[e.g.][]{routtenberg00, maviel04, restivo09}. Furthermore, there are also evidence of for the transfering process to occur during sleep, for example, task-related coordinated activity between hippocampus and visual cortex has been round in rats \citep{ji07}. 

The standard model is not without criticism. As the standard model is similar to the original \citet{marr71}'s model, the line of critism involving place cells to \citet{marr71}'s model also applies to the standard model, as the orientation of the animal in an environment critically depends on hippocampus, even long after encoding when the memory consolidation is thought to be complete \citet[e.g.][]{mumby99, sutherland01, clark05}. Moreover, close examination of \gls{mtl} lesion patients reveals that they have global deficits in recalling details of episodic memory, and this deficit is not temporally graded \citep{cipolotti01, viskontas02}. Other evidence suggest for certain more demanding memory tasks, hippocampus is also active during memory recall after consolidation \citep{ryan01, wheeler13}. These criticisms of the standard model leads to development of the multiple trace theory (discussed in \ref{hpc-mtt}).

\subsubsection{Multiple trace theory \label{hpc-mtt}}
The multiple trace theory is an extension of the standard model. Like the standard model, the multiple trace theory also acknowledges that the hippocampus automatically encode all information during memory formation, and that hippocampus initiates a representation of memory in the cortex \citep{nadel97}. However the multiple trace theory differentiates itself from the standard model on several accounts. First, the multiple trace theory differentiates declarative memory into episodic memory (memory of events) and semantic memory (memory of facts), and states that the two kinds of memory are formed differently. The multiple trace theory then proposes that for episodic memories, there is no consolidation process, and the memory is represented by both hippocampus and cortex. However, upon reactivation of an old episodic memory, a new hippocampal representation is formed to link some of the cortical representation. The multiple trace theory argues that the multiple hippocampal representation provides robustness to the underlying memory, so they are less likely to be disrupted \citep{nadel97}. 

As a result of this, the multiple trace theory have several different predictions, especially regarding to the encoding of episodic memory, compared to the standard model. First, it predicts that reactivation of memory, no matter how old the memory is, will  depend on hippocampus, while for the standard model, older memories are more independent of hippocampus. Secondly, the multiple trace theory predicts as memories get older, the hippocampal activation will be stronger and more distributed due to the multiple traces, and the standard model will predict the opposite. Thirdly, the multiple trace theory implicates that reactivation of an memory, as new traces are formed in hippocampus and cortex, provide a window to update the memory, while in the standard model reactivation of the memory should not have any effects on the underlying neural representation. 

The dissociation of semantic and episodic memories the multiple trace theory identifed is well supported. For example in the retrograde amnesia caused by \gls{mtl} lesion, episodic memories are usually severely impaired, often dates back for decades or even lifetime, while semantic memories are less affected and temporal graded \citep{kabur97, vargha-khadem97, moscovitch05}. Moreover, hippocampal activation has been consistently reported during recall of episodic memory \citep{maguire01, svoboda06}. In addition, it has been established, both in animal models and humans, that reactivation of memory creates a window to alter the original memory representation \citep{wang10, dunbar16}.

On the other hand, many predictions of multiple trace is not validated. For example, hippocampal activation during the recall of a remote memory is at the similar level to that of a recent memory \citep{addis04, steinvorth06, wheeler10}, which is against of what multiple trace theory has predicted. Moreover, while multiple trace theory predicts partial lesion of hippocampus leads to temporal-graded amnesia, this is not found in rodent models \citep{sutherland10}, and inconsistently in humans \citep{yassa13}. The biological relavance of multiple trace theory has also been questioned, as it seems to require a huge amount of storage for the multiple traces, which hippocampus cannot provide \todo{cite?}. 

In conclusion, the multiple trace theory has been influential in recent studies in reconsolidation, and potentially providing novel treatment for many psychiatrical conditions \citep{dunbar16}, however evidence exists against many of its core predictions. Efforts are still being made to amend multiple trace theory to account the negative evidence \citep{moscovitch05, yassa13}.
