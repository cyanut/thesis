\chapter{General Methods}

\section{Mice}

Wildtype C57/BL6 $\times$ 129 F1 mice of 3-months age were used in the experiments. All animals were caged in groups of 4 or 5, with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. All experiments are performed during the light phase of the cycle. Food and water are provided \textit{ad libitum} to all animals. All procedures are approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee in the Hospital for Sick Children.

\section{Viral Infusion}\label{methods.viralinfusion}

Each animal received \gls{ip} injection of atropine (\SI{0.1}{\mg\per\kg}) and chlorohydrate (\SI{400}{\mg\per\kg}) before being secured on a stereotaxic frame. An incision was made on the scalp and the skin was pulled to the side to reveal the skull. Holes were drilled above \gls{la} on the skull for micropipette injection. Virus was loaded into a glass micropipette and gradually lowered to target coordinate. \SI{1.5}{\ul} of virus were injected on each side at a rate of \SI{0.12}{\ul\per\min}, aiming at \gls{la} (\gls{a/p} \SI{-1.4}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} $\pm$\SI{3.5}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{5.0}{\mm} from Bregma). The micropipette was left in the brain for an extra \si{10}{\min} before slowly retracted. The incision was sutured and treated with antibiotics. Each animal then received subcutaneous injection of analgesic (ketoprofen, \SI{5}{\mg\per\kg}) before returned to a partially heated clean cage for recovery. All behaviour experiments are conducted at least 3 days after surgery.


\section{\Acrlong{afc}}

The \gls{afc} chamber (Med Associates) consists of two plexiglass walls and two metal walls, with an overhead camera for recording animal behaviour and a metal grid floor for shock delivery. The chamber was cleaned with water before \gls{afc} training. The animals were placed in the chamber and allowed for a 2-minute habituation. A tone (\SI{2800}{\Hz}, \SI{85}{\dB}) was played for \SI{30}{\second} and co-terminated with a 2-second shock (\SI{0.7}{\mA}). The animals were allowed to rest in their home cage until early in their next light cycle when they were sacrificed for analysis. \todo{complete methods for fear testing}
