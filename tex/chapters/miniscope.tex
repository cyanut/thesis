\chapter{Construction of a miniature epi-fluorescence microscope \label{chap-scope}}

\section{Introduction}

One of the major technological limitation in neuroscience research is recording neural activity in model animals. Traditional techniques such multi-unit recordings give excellent temporal resolution, however the spatial resolution --- as measured by the number of cells simultaneously recorded --- is limited. Moreover, it is very hard to distinguish cell subpopulations within the same region from the recording. Neural activity can also be inferred by \textit{post mortem} staining of neural activity markers, such as cfos or arc. This method give excellent spatial resolution, however the temporal resolution is very poor, where the time window of neural activity lasts from minutes to hours.

    Live calcium imaging combines the best of both methods. By labelling the cell of interest with a calcium indicator, neural activity can be recorded with milli-second resolution. Hundreds of cells can be simultaneously recorded, and specific subpopulations can be distinguished by fluorescence in different colour channels. However, traditional live calcium imaging requires the animals' head firmly fixed under a microscope stage. This requirement is incompatible with most well established behaviour assays, and at the same time introduce significant stress to the animal, potentially confounding the behavioural result. Moreover, due to light scattering in the opaque brain tissue, most of the studies have focused only on cortical areas, while techniques to image deep brain tissue on a standard two-photon microscope is still under development and not widely adopted \citep{barretto12}.

    \textit{In vivo} calcium imaging in behaving animals was first demonstrated by Mark Schnitzer's group in Stanford \citep{ghosh11}. The authors constructed a miniature epifluorescence microscope which is chronically implanted in the brain to image the fluorescence from region of interest. In a follow-up paper \citep{ziv13}, the authors demonstrated that the miniature microscope can image GCaMP3 calcium signals from hippocampal \gls{ca1} place cells for more than a month. However, there are several limitations with their design: first their design incorporates an objective lens of \SI{1}{\mm}  in diameter, which is impractical to reach deep brain tissue; second, their mini-microscope was only able to identify GCaMP signals, and therefore unable to distinguish different cells types within the population \citep{ghosh11,ziv13}. 

    In the current project, I tackled the above mentioned limitations by building a head-mount miniature microscope which is able to image calcium signals in deep brain structures, while also able to image a separate fluorescence colour channel, allowing to distinguish difference cell type. The mini-microscope, once developed, will be used for imaging \gls{la} neurons to investigate mechanisms of fear memory encoding. Moreover, I created an simple open design with little requirement of engineering experience to assemble, so it can be assembled and used cost-efficiently in most neuroscience laboratories. 

\section{Material and Methods}

\subsection{General design of the mini-microscope}

The mini-microscope has the same design as an general single-photon epifluorescence microscope except for the size constraints. Excitation light is emitted from a high-intensity \gls{led} light source, filtered, and reflected by a dichroic mirror to illuminate the sample. The fluorescent emission light from the sample is collected by the objective, passes through the dichroic mirror, filtered and focused on the camera. To fit the size constraints, we chose a high-intensity \gls{led} as the light source, a \gls{grin} lens as an objective, and a miniaturized \gls{cmos} camera to capture the image (Figure \ref{f.scope-schema}).

The optical design of the microscope was accomplished using Zemax software (Zemax Development Corporation) to optimize the lens and filter configuration. The casing of the microscope is modelled using OpenSCAD software. 

\subsubsection{Lens configuration}

The lenses configuration consists of a \gls{grin} objective lens and a ocular barrel lens forming a ``4F system'', where the distance between the thin-lens equivalent of the two lenses equals to the sum of the focal length. Potential lenses for emission light path were selected from modelling and calculation to give a working distance of \SI{100}{\um} in water, a magnification of 6x and a back focal length of \SI{6}{\cm}. During prototyping, the lenses were purchased and installed into custom-made mounts on a two-arm stereotaxic frame. The distance of the lenses was then optimized against a fibre bundle light source close to the \gls{grin} lens. A drum lens was used to collect light from the \gls{led}. The drum lens is tested in a similar manner and selected to give diverging light after \gls{grin} lens. We has chose to use an achromatic doublet (F=\SI{15}{\mm}, Edmund Optics). We used a \SI{1.8}{\mm} diameter 0.25-pitch \gls{grin} lens (64--537, Edmund Optics) as objective for hippocampus imaging. To minimize brain damage for deep brain imaging, the objective lens was a home-assembled doublet of a \SI{0.5}{\mm} diameter, 1-pitch \gls{grin} relay lens (ILW-050-P050, GoFoton) and a \SI{2}{\mm} diameter 0.25-pitch \gls{grin} lens (ILW-200-P025, GoFoton). The details of doublet assembly is described in \ref{objective-assembly}.

\subsubsection{Filter selection}
The filters were selected to cover the excitation and emission spectrum of the genetic encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6f \citep{chen13} and further screened for high bandwidth and low overlap. To fit the size constraints, the excitation and emission filters had dimensions of \SI{5x5x1}{\mm}, and the dichroic mirror \SI{7.1x5x1}{\mm}. We chose to use a \gls{fitc} filter set for gCaMP6 imaging (49002, Chroma). For dual colour imaging, we took advantage of broad excitation spectrum of the red retrobeads, and use the same blue light to excite the red fluorophore. In these experiments, a \acrshort{tritc}\slash\acrshort{fitc} with single band exciter filter set was used (59204, Chroma).

\subsubsection{Electronics}
The image sensor were selected to have a packaged size of less than \SI{1.5 x 1.5}{\cm}. We used a commercially available analogue camera module (HD1313BW, Ruishibao) that gives satisfactory sensitivity and dynamic range. The camera board is connected to a \SI{5}{\V} power regulator. After the power regulator, the wires were connected through a slip ring (SRC012-C, Adafruit) to avoid entanglement of the wires during animal behaviour. After the slip ring, the wires are connected to a \SI{12}{\V} \gls{dc} power source and a \gls{usb} analogue video capture card (Capit, Mygica). The video capture card is controlled by custom software for synchronized video capture.  Alternatively, a board-level miniature integrated digital camera (MU9PM-MBRD, XIMEA) can be used. While the XIMEA camera adds significant cost to the miniature microscope, it allows custom control of camera parameters such as pixel binning, gain and exposure. The XIMEA also output in 12-bit per pixel, and gives better overall \gls{snr}.

A monochrome, high-intensity blue \gls{led} (LXML-PB01-0023, Lumiled) was used as the light source. The \gls{led} wires joins the video camera wires through the slip ring, and then connected to a variable \gls{dc} power source. During recording, the \gls{led} was driven at a current between \SI{20}{\mA} and \SI{50}{\mA}.

\subsubsection{Casing and assembly}
The casing was printed in black resin using a Form 2 3D printer (Formlabs). This gives a black, rigid and opaque casing with highest resolution for details. The microscope body is screwed onto the camera holder via a printed M8 thread to allow easy change of the focus plane. A side M2$\times$\SI{2}{\mm} nylon screw is used to lock the camera holder on the microscope body and fix the focus of the mini-microscope. 

We used parts from a \SI{2.5}{\mm} phone jack for the connection between the microscope body and baseplate. The phone jack is widely available, and the low-profile fine thread interface allows easy and firm connection of the mini-microscope body to the baseplate. The threaded tube was sawed off from the phone jack and glued to the bottom the mini-microscope body, and the corresponding nut was glued to the 3D-printed baseplate. The objective \gls{grin} lens was inserted vertically into the center of the baseplate, and fixed with optical adhesive (NOA61, Norland). The drum lens and filters were snug-fitted into the corresponding slot in the filter box, and the \gls{led} was fixed onto the filter box with epoxy glue. 

\subsubsection{Objective lens assembly for deep brain imaging} \label{objective-assembly}

For deep brain imaging, a \SI{0.5}{\mm} diameter, 1.0-pitch relay lens was connected to the center of a \SI{2}{\mm} diameter, 0.25-pitch \gls{grin} lens using optical adhesive (NOA61, Norland). The setup is modified from \citep{kim12} to ensure concentricity and alignment. In the setup, a micro V-clamp (VK250, ThorLab) is used to hold the large \gls{grin} lens in place vertically, and the thin relay lens was mounted on another V-groove clamp attached to a 3-axis manipulator (E.g., DT12XYZ, ThorLabs). The two micro V-clamps were leveled using a bull's eye spirit level. A lens and camera chip was mounted under the large \gls{grin} lens, which captures and displays the image of the large \gls{grin} lens on a monitor for monitoring the relative horizontal position of the two lenses. A dissection microscope was mounted horizontally for monitoring the vertical position of the two lenses. \todo{insert figure for the setup}

During assembly, both lenses were mounted in the V-clamps respectively. A small drop of \gls{uv} curing optical adhesive (NOA61, Norland) was added to the bottom surface of the relay lens using a 27-gauge needle. The relay lens was then lower to just above the large \gls{grin} lens when an image of the relay lens is visible on the monitor. The relay lens was then moved to the center of the large \gls{grin} lens according to the monitor display. Observed through the dissecting microscope, the relay lens was then lowered to touch the upper surface of the large \gls{grin} lens. A \SI{375}{\nm} spot \gls{uv} light source (Spotty-B, Fusionet) was used to cure the optical adhesive. The curing time is calculated to give at least \SI{3}{\J\per\mm\squared} of \gls{uv} light on the optical adhesive. 

\subsection{Viral Infusion \label{viral-infusion}}

Each mouse received \gls{ip} injection of atropine (\SI{0.1}{\mg\per\kg}) and chlorohydrate (\SI{400}{\mg\per\kg}) before being secured on a stereotaxic frame. An incision was made on the scalp and the skin was pulled to the side to reveal the skull. Holes were drilled above the brain region of interest on the skull for micropipette injection. \SI{1.0}{\ul} AAV-syn-GCaMP6 virus was loaded into a glass micropipette and gradually lowered to target coordinate (\gls{ca1}: \gls{a/p} \SI{-1.8}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} \SI{1.5}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{-1.5}{\mm} from Bregma; \gls{la}: \gls{a/p} \SI{-1.4}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} \SI{3.5}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{5.0}{\mm} from Bregma), and injected at a rate of \SI{0.12}{\ul\per\min}. The micropipette was left in the brain for an extra \SI{10}{\min} before slowly retracted. The incision was sutured and treated with antibiotics. Each mouse then received subcutaneous injection of analgesic (ketoprofen, \SI{5}{\mg\per\kg}) before returned to a partially heated clean cage for recovery.

\subsection{Implantation of the mini-microscope}

Mice with viral expression of gCaMP6 were anesthetized and head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame as described in Section \ref{viral-infusion}. Three screws were placed around the viral injection site for anchoring the microscope. For implantation targeting \gls{ca1}, a circular craniology of \SI{2}{\mm} was performed above the viral injection site. The dura was pierced and lifted with a fine tweezer to expose the brain. The brain was then constantly irrigated with artificial cerebral-spinal fluid to remove the blood. A 27-gauge aspiration needle was used to remove cortex and expose \gls{ca1}. For implantation targeting amygdala after anchoring the screws, a 27-gauge needle was lowered to the target coordinate, left for \SI{5}{\min}, and slowly retracted to create a canal for the thin lens implant.

The mini-microscope is then fixed on the stereotaxic frame and gradually lowered to \SI{0.2}{\mm} above the target coordinates (\gls{ca1}: \gls{a/p} \SI{-1.8}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} \SI{1.5}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{-1.3}{\mm} from Bregma; \gls{la}: \gls{a/p} \SI{-1.4}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} \SI{3.4}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{-4.8}{\mm} from Bregma). Opaque black dental acrylic was applied to secure the microscope baseplate to the skull. Once the dental acrylic was cured, the microscope body was detached from the baseplate and replaced with a cap. Mice were given \SI{5}{\mg\per\kg} ketoprofen for analgesia before returned to a clean cage for recovery.

\subsection{In vivo mini-microscope testing}
After lens implantation, the mice were kept in the home cage for at least two weeks before the first image session. This time allows the optical window to clear. The mice were handled, the cap was removed and replaced with the microscope body. A typical imaging session lasted for at least \SI{5}{\minute}. After the imaging session, the microscope body was removed, the mice were recapped and returned to their home cage.

\subsection{Image analysis}

\subsubsection{Extracting cell from calcium imaging video}

All traces were normalized to have zero median and unit noise standard deviation. The noise standard deviation was estimated from median absolute deviation of the trace. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) was calculated as the ratio of maximum signal intensity and noise standard deviation. Only traces with more than 10 SNR and animals with more than 20 cells are included in the analysis. The average activity of a cell was calculated by the area under the calcium trace above 3 standard deviation of the noise divided by duration.

Before processing, the raw videos were corrected for uneven illumination by applying a high-pass Gaussian filter (\SI{20 x 20}{\um} kernel) to each frame. To reduce computational time, the videos were then down-sampled to 5 fps for processing. Individual cell calcium signals were extracted from the video similarly to previously described \citep{mukamel09}. First, the illumination-corrected down-sampled video was regarded as a matrix of pixels by time, and \gls{pca} was applied to reduce the temporal dimension to 300-500 components. The principal components were then regarded as mixtures of individual cells, and separated by \gls{ica}. \Gls{ica} components with a single mode and 90\% peak width of less than \SI{30}{\um} were classified as cells. The time-course of cell components were calculated by multiplying the inverse of \gls{ica} component matrix with the corresponding illumination-corrected raw video.

\subsubsection{Mapping cells across session}
Cells were extracted from the recordings for both the training and test session respectively. The position of the each cells was calculated as the center of mass of pixels above the \num{90} percentile intensity in the extracted \gls{ica} components. The position of cells for each recording were approximately aligned to have overlapping center of mass, then rotated to have overlapping principle component vectors. The two point clouds were then precisely aligned using a manual approximation and finally \gls{trimicp} \citep{chetverikov02}. \Gls{trimicp} is robust against outliers, which allows accurate alignment even when cells were observed in one session but missing in another. \Gls{trimicp} was performed using a \SI{40}{\percent} outlier ratio, optimizing both translation and rotation. After alignment, cells that are less than \SI{2}{\um} from one session to another were marked as the same cell. 


\section{Results}

\subsection{Capability and \textit{in vitro} testing of the mini-microscope}
The mini-microscope provides as a easy and inexpensive tool for neuroscience laboratories to measure calcium activity in freely behaving animals. Our completely assembled mini-microscope weighs less than \SI{3}{\g}, and can be bounded in a \SI{25 x 16 x 11}{\mm} box (Figure~\ref{f.scope}). Adult mice with the mini-microscope attached are able to rear, groom, and freely explore environment with no noticeable change from their natural behaviour.

The theoretical optical resolution of the mini-microscope is \SI{1}{\um}. To measure the resolution empirically, we tested the mini-microscope against \gls{usaf} resolution target (38-257, Edmund Optics). As shown in Figure~\ref{f.usaf}, the thinest lines (group 7 element 6, \SI{2.07}{\um} width) are clearly distinguishable. This suggest that the empirical resolution of the microscope is smaller than \SI{2}{\um}. With this resolution, the mini-microscope is able to resolve cell bodies and capillary blood vessels.

We first tested the mini-microscope in a perfused fluorescent brain. We virally expressed \gls{gfp} in the \gls{la} of a mice using \gls{hsv}, and perfused and harvested the brain 3 days later when the \gls{gfp} expression peaks. The brain was sliced coronally on a vibratome until fluorescence is detectable on the cutting surface. The trunk of the brain was then imaged under the mini-microscope. As seen in Figure~\ref{f.scope-gfp}, the \gls{gfp} cell bodies and the apical dendrites can be resolved from the mini-microscope image. This result confirms that the fluorescence under the \gls{led} illumination can be reliably detected by the \gls{cmos} camera.

\subsection{Measuring blood flow with mini-microscope}
To test the \textit{in vivo} imaging capability of the microscope, we first implanted the mini-microscope above the cortex, and injected \SI{150}{\ul} of fluorescein-dextran (molecular weight \SI{150}{\kilo\dalton}; FD150, Sigma) in the tail vein of the mice. The fluorescein-dextran will fill the blood vessels, and fluoresce with similar excitation and emission wavelength to GCaMP. As expected, after fluorescein-dextran injection, the blood vessels are clearly visible when the microscope is implanted (Figure~\ref{f.bloodvessel}).

\end{figure}


\subsection{Recording calcium transients in CA1}
To test GCaMP6s expression \textit{in vivo}, we infused AAV--syn--GCaMP6s--WPRE into \gls{ca1} hippocampus and implanted the mini-microscope above the injection site. During behavioural session, the animal was placed in a novel environment to explore for \SI{5}{\minute}, during which GCaMP6 fluorescence were recorded. The maximum projection of the GCaMP6 fluorescence in a 5-minute session is shown in Figure~\ref{f.ca1bw}. We were able to extract 200 cells from the recording and their corresponding \ce{Ca^2+} transients (Figure~\ref{f.analysis}, \ref{f.ca1rainbow}).

The positions of the animal was traced out in the behaviour video. The timecourse of the identified cells were mapped back to the behaviour of the animal. Figure~\ref{f.traceplot} shows \ce{Ca^2+} activity of potential place cells as they respond to specific location in the environment the animal is in.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Video preprocessing}
\subsubsection{Illumination correction}
The size of the mini-microscope limits the illumination pathway, and, as a result, the illumination in the \gls{fov} is uneven. An uneven illumination not only affects the calcium signal and cell detection, but also adds difficulty to the motion correction step, since the uneven illumination pattern appears stable even when there is relative movement between the mini-microscope and the target. To correct this, a 2D Gaussian filter with large window (\SI{20x20}{\um}) is convolved with each frame. The lower frequency image is regarded as the illumination pattern. The illumination pattern is then subtracted from the frame and normalized. Figure~\ref{f.illumination} shows the maximum projection of an \textit{in vivo} video recording of \gls{ca1} cells expressing gCaMP6f before and after illumination correction. Cells under intense illumination in the center can be clearly visualized after illumination correction.

Cells in the center of the \gls{fov} are clearly visible after illumination correction. \label{f.illumination}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Motion correction}
After illumination correction, the video was then de-dusted and corrected for motion. Occasional dust speckles on the camera appear as stationary small dark objects in the video, and interfere with motion detection. To remove the dust speckles, pixels two standard deviation darker than mean intensity were labeled for each frame. The labeled pixels are morphologically eroded and dilated to remove labeling noise, and then inpainted using Navier-Stokes based methods \citep{bertalmio01}.

As the motion is almost entirely translational, after dust removal we used phase correlation algorithm to achieved sub-pixel level motion correction \citep{guizar08}. The reference frame is initialized to be the first frame. A moving average of 25 registered frames was generated, and the reference frame is updated by maximum projection of the moving average frame to the reference frame. To test the efficacy of the motion correction algorithm, we generated a recording with significant motion artifact by loosing the connection of the mini-microscope to the baseplate during recording. As can be seen from the maximum projection of the original recording and stabilized recording (Figure~\ref{f.motion}), after motion correction, we are able to obtain a stable image of cells, even with significant motion artifact in the original video.

\subsection{Between session stability}
To measure the stability of the imaging field between sessions, animals with gCaMP6 infused in \gls{ca1} underwent contextual fear conditioning, and \SI{24}{\hour} later, were placed back in the same context for testing. Mini-microscope was attached during both imaging sessions, and the recordings are aligned as shown in \ref{f.cellalign}. In this mouse, we are able to detect 88 active cells from day 1 and 70 active cells from day 2. We are able to align videos from both sessions and found 57 cells active for both sessions. This result is similar to previously reported results \citep{ziv13}, and validates our method to map cells between sessions.

Yellow dotted lines shows mapping from a day 2 cell to its image in day 1 (represented with green dots). \label{f.cellalign}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Deep brain imaging}
My original design of the miniature microscope incorporates an objective lens of \SI{1.8}{\mm} in diameter. This lens is both too thick and too short to reach deep brain structures such as \gls{la}. We modified the design and attached a \SI{4.8}{\mm} long \SI{0.5}{\mm} diameter relay \gls{grin} lens (ILW-050-P050, GoFoton) to the objective lens. Attaching the relay lens does not significantly alter the imaging ability of the mini-microscope, but allows the lens to reach deep brain regions without extensive damage. With this configuration, we are able to record neural activity form more than 40 cells in \gls{la} and track them over time (Figure~\ref{f.amygdala}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Two colour}
To test the two-colour version of the mini-microscope, we infused red retrobeads (Lumafluor) into the \gls{nac} bilaterally and gCaMP6-expressing \gls{aav} in \gls{la}. The retrobeads will be trafficked retrogradely along axons, and will label \gls{la} neurons that project to \gls{nac}. The images acquired from both the green and red channel are shown in Figure~\ref{f.twocolour.g.invivo} and \ref{f.twocolour.r.invivo}. Importantly, there is no interference between the two channels.

\section{Discussion}

In the current project, we developed a miniature integrated microscope for calcium imaging in freely behaving mice. The mini-microscope weighs less than \SI{3}{\gram}, and can be implanted on a mouse's head without altering the mouse's natural behaviour. We successfully used it to record calcium transients both from \gls{ca1} in dorsal hippocampus and \gls{la}. Moreover, we added an additional red colour channel for subpopulation identification. With the additional colour channel, we shown that it is possible to identify cells with specific projection target by retrograde tracing using fluorescent retrobeads. 

Compared to previous designs of mini-microscope, our design is simpler to build and more cost efficient, which makes it suitable for common neuroscience laboratories. All optical and electronic parts are commercially available, and the casing can be 3D-printed. The mini-microscope is designed to be easily assembled with minimal tools. The design allows biology researchers with minimal engineering experience to build the mini-microscope and use it for biological research. Moreover, the complete cost a single mini-microscope is between \$\,300 and \$\,1000, and will not represent a significant expense in most biology laboratories.

Here we used PCA--ICA for sorting the cells from videos. It is worth noting that although this method can extract cells and traces reliably, it is not optimal: the PCA--ICA method can only catch statistical regularities in the cell activity, but any spatial information is ignored. As a result, if the statistic distribution of cell activity is similar between some cells, for example if the duration of the video is relative short or there are cells fire in synchrony, the PCA--ICA is unable to extract individual cells correctly. In addition, the result of PCA--ICA may include negative values in the cell activity, which should be limited to only positive values. Recently, \citet{pnevmatikakis16} used a \gls{cnmf} approach for cell sorting from calcium imaging videos. This method took consideration of the spatial information of each cell, as well as the activity signature of the calcium indicators, and has been shown to be more accurate from PCA--ICA in videos acquired from two-photon microscopes. It is promising that a similar \gls{cnmf} approach can be applied to the mini-microscope dataset for cell sorting. 

In the two-colour version of the mini-microscope, colour aberration still exists, such that the alignment of the red and green channels is not perfect. However, the colour aberration is not significant, and will only result in a theoretical shift of \SI{2}{\um} in the field of view. Given that the diameter of a neuron is usually more than \SI{10}{\um}, this misalignment will not significant affect the identification of neural subpopulations in the red channel. The colour aberration is primarily introduced by the \gls{grin} lens, and can be corrected by using a \gls{grin} lens with optimal radial refractory index profile. However although technically possible, such \gls{grin} lens is not currently commercially available.
