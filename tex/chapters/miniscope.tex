\chapter{Construction of a miniature epi-fluorescence microscope \label{chap-scope}}

\section{Introduction}

One of the major technological limitations in neuroscience research is recording neural activity in model animals. Traditional techniques such multi-unit recordings give excellent temporal resolution, however the spatial resolution --- as measured by the number of cells simultaneously recorded --- is limited. Moreover, it is very hard to distinguish cell subpopulations within the same region from the recording. Neural activity can also be inferred by \textit{post mortem} staining of neural activity markers, such as cfos or arc. This method gives excellent spatial resolution, however the temporal resolution is very poor, where the time window of neural activity lasts from minutes to hours.

    Live calcium imaging combines the best of both methods. By labelling cells of interest with a calcium indicator, neural activity can be recorded with millisecond resolution. Hundreds of cells can be simultaneously recorded, and specific subpopulations can be distinguished by fluorescence in different colour channels. However, traditional live calcium imaging requires the animals' head to be firmly fixed under a microscope stage. This requirement is incompatible with most well established behaviour assays, and at the same time introduces significant stress on the animal, potentially confounding behavioural results. Moreover, due to light scattering in opaque brain tissue, most of the studies have focused only on cortical areas, while techniques to image deep brain tissue on a standard two-photon microscope are still under development and not widely adopted \citep{barretto12}.

    \textit{In vivo} calcium imaging in behaving animals was first demonstrated by Mark Schnitzer's group at Stanford \citep{ghosh11}. The authors constructed a miniature epifluorescence microscope which was chronically implanted in the brain to image fluorescence from region of interest. In a follow-up paper \citep{ziv13}, the authors demonstrated that their miniature microscope could image GCaMP3 calcium signals from hippocampal \gls{ca1} place cells for more than a month. However, there are several limitations to their design: first their design incorporates an objective lens \SI{1}{\mm}  in diameter, which is impractical to reach deep brain tissue; second, their mini-microscope was only able to identify GCaMP signals, and therefore unable to distinguish different cells types within the population \citep{ghosh11,ziv13}. 

    In the current project, I tackled the above mentioned limitations by building a head-mounted miniature microscope which is able to image calcium signals in deep brain structures, and is also capable of imaging a separate fluorescence colour channel in order to distinguish different cell types. The mini-microscope, once developed, will be used for imaging \gls{la} neurons to investigate mechanisms of fear memory encoding. Moreover, I created an simple open design which requires little engineering experience to assemble, so it can be assembled and used cost-efficiently in most neuroscience laboratories. 

\section{Material and Methods}

\subsection{General design of the mini-microscope}

The mini-microscope has the same design as an general single-photon epifluorescence microscope except for size constraints. Excitation light is emitted from a high-intensity \gls{led} light source, filtered, and reflected by a dichroic mirror to illuminate the sample. The fluorescent emission light from the sample is collected by the objective, passes through the dichroic mirror, and is filtered and focused on the camera. To fit the necessary size constraints, we chose a high-intensity \gls{led} as the light source, a \gls{grin} lens as an objective, and a miniaturized \gls{cmos} camera to capture the image (Figure \ref{f.scope-schema}).

The optical design of the microscope was accomplished using Zemax software (Zemax Development Corporation) to optimize the lens and filter configuration. The casing of the microscope was modelled using OpenSCAD software. 

\subsubsection{Lens configuration}

The lens configuration consists of a \gls{grin} objective lens and a ocular barrel lens forming a ``4F system'', where the distance between the thin-lens equivalent of the two lenses equals to the sum of the focal length. Potential lenses for emission light path were selected from modelling and calculation to give a working distance of \SI{100}{\um} in water, a magnification of 6x and a back focal length of \SI{6}{\cm}. During prototyping, the lenses were purchased and installed into custom-made mounts on a two-arm stereotaxic frame. The distance between the lenses was then optimized against a fibre bundle light source close to the \gls{grin} lens. A drum lens was used to collect light from the \gls{led}. The drum lens was tested in a similar manner and selected to produce diverging light after the \gls{grin} lens. We chose to use an achromatic doublet (F=\SI{15}{\mm}, Edmund Optics). We used a \SI{1.8}{\mm} diameter 0.25-pitch \gls{grin} lens (64--537, Edmund Optics) as objective for hippocampus imaging. To minimize brain damage for deep brain imaging, the objective lens was a home-assembled doublet of a \SI{0.5}{\mm} diameter, 1-pitch \gls{grin} relay lens (ILW-050-P050, GoFoton) and a \SI{2}{\mm} diameter 0.25-pitch \gls{grin} lens (ILW-200-P025, GoFoton). The details of doublet assembly are described in section \ref{objective-assembly}.

\subsubsection{Filter selection}
Filters were selected to cover the excitation and emission spectra of the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6f \citep{chen13} and further screened for high bandwidth and low overlap. To fit the size constraints, the excitation and emission filters had dimensions of \SI{4x4x1}{\mm}, and the dichroic mirror was \SI{5.6x4x1}{\mm}. We chose to use a \gls{fitc} filter set for gCaMP6 imaging (49002, Chroma). For dual colour imaging, we took advantage of broad excitation spectrum of the red retrobeads, and used the same blue light to excite the red fluorophore. In these experiments, a \acrshort{tritc}\slash\acrshort{fitc} with single band exciter filter set was used (59204, Chroma).

\subsubsection{Electronics}
The image sensor was selected to have a package size of less than \SI{1.5 x 1.5}{\cm}. We used a commercially available analogue camera module (HD1313BW, Ruishibao) that gave satisfactory sensitivity and dynamic range. The camera board was connected to a \SI{5}{\V} power regulator. After the power regulator, the wires were connected through a slip ring (SRC012-C, Adafruit) to avoid tangling of the wires during animal behaviour. After the slip ring, the wires are connected to a \SI{12}{\V} \gls{dc} power source and a \gls{usb} analogue video capture card (Capit, Mygica). The video capture card was controlled by custom software for synchronized video capture.  Alternatively, a board-level miniature integrated digital camera (MU9PM-MBRD, XIMEA) could also be used. While the XIMEA camera adds significant cost to the miniature microscope, it allows custom control of camera parameters such as pixel binning, gain and exposure. The XIMEA camera also outputs in 12-bit per pixel, and gives a better overall \gls{snr}.

A monochrome, high-intensity blue \gls{led} (LXML-PB01-0023, Lumiled) was used as the light source. The wires providing power to the \gls{led} joined the video camera wires through the slip ring, and were then connected to a variable \gls{dc} power source. During recording, the \gls{led} was driven at a current between \SI{20}{\mA} and \SI{50}{\mA}.

\subsubsection{Casing and assembly}
The microscope casing was printed in black resin (GPBK02, Formlabs) using a Form 2 3D printer (Formlabs, Sommerville MA). This material renders a black, rigid and opaque casing with a feature resolution of \SI{25}{\um}. The microscope body was screwed onto the camera holder via a printed M8 thread to allow easy change of the focal plane. A side-mounted M2$\times$\SI{2}{\mm} nylon set screw was used to lock the camera holder on the microscope body and fix the focus of the mini-microscope. 

We used parts from a \SI{2.5}{\mm} phone jack for the connection between the microscope body and baseplate. The phone jack is widely available, and the low-profile fine thread interface allows easy and firm connection of the mini-microscope body to the baseplate. The threaded tube was sawed off from the phone jack and glued to the bottom the mini-microscope body, and the corresponding nut was glued to the 3D-printed baseplate. The objective \gls{grin} lens was inserted vertically into the center of the baseplate, and fixed with optical adhesive (NOA61, Norland). The drum lens and filters were snugly fitted into corresponding slots in the filter box, and the \gls{led} was fixed onto the filter box with two-part epoxy adhesive. 

\subsubsection{Objective lens assembly for deep brain imaging} \label{objective-assembly}

For deep brain imaging, a \SI{0.5}{\mm} diameter, 1.0-pitch relay lens was connected to the center of a \SI{2}{\mm} diameter, 0.25-pitch \gls{grin} lens using optical adhesive (NOA61, Norland). The setup was modified from \citep{kim12} to ensure concentricity and alignment. In the setup, a micro V-clamp (VK250, ThorLab) was used to hold the large \gls{grin} lens in place vertically, and the thin relay lens was mounted on another V-groove clamp attached to a 3-axis manipulator (E.g., DT12XYZ, ThorLabs). The two micro V-clamps were leveled using a bull's eye spirit level. A lens and camera chip were mounted under the large \gls{grin} lens, and were used to capture and display the image of the large \gls{grin} lens on a monitor for monitoring the relative horizontal position of the two lenses. A dissection microscope was mounted horizontally for monitoring the vertical position of the two lenses. 


During assembly, both lenses were mounted in the V-clamps respectively. A small drop of \gls{uv} curing optical adhesive (NOA61, Norland) was added to the bottom surface of the relay lens using a 27-gauge needle. The relay lens was then lowered to just above the large \gls{grin} lens, when an image of the relay lens became visible on the monitor. The relay lens was then moved to the center of the large \gls{grin} lens according to the monitor display. Observed through the dissecting microscope, the relay lens was then lowered to touch the upper surface of the large \gls{grin} lens. A \SI{375}{\nm} spot \gls{uv} light source (Spotty-B, Fusionet) was used to cure the optical adhesive. The curing time is calculated to give at least \SI{3}{\J\per\mm\squared} of \gls{uv} light on the optical adhesive.

\subsection{Viral Infusion \label{viral-infusion}}

Each mouse received \gls{ip} injection of atropine (\SI{0.1}{\mg\per\kg}) and chlorohydrate (\SI{400}{\mg\per\kg}) before being secured on a stereotaxic frame. An incision was made on the scalp and the skin was pulled to the side to reveal the skull. Holes were drilled above the brain region of interest on the skull for micropipette injection. \SI{1.0}{\ul} AAV-syn-GCaMP6 virus was loaded into a glass micropipette and gradually lowered to target coordinate (\gls{ca1}: \gls{a/p} \SI{-1.8}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} \SI{1.5}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{-1.5}{\mm} from Bregma; \gls{la}: \gls{a/p} \SI{-1.4}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} \SI{3.5}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{5.0}{\mm} from Bregma), and injected at a rate of \SI{0.12}{\ul\per\min}. The micropipette was left in the brain for an extra \SI{10}{\min} before slowly retracted. The incision was sutured and treated with antibiotics. Each mouse then received subcutaneous injection of analgesic (ketoprofen, \SI{5}{\mg\per\kg}) before returned to a partially heated clean cage for recovery.

\subsection{Implantation of the mini-microscope}

Mice with viral expression of gCaMP6 were anesthetized and head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame as described in Section \ref{viral-infusion}. Three screws were placed around the viral injection site for anchoring of the microscope. For implantation targeting \gls{ca1}, a circular craniology of \SI{2}{\mm} was performed above the viral injection site. The dura was pierced and lifted with fine tweezers to expose the brain. The brain was then continually irrigated with artificial cerebral-spinal fluid to remove the blood. A 27-gauge aspiration needle was used to remove cortex and expose \gls{ca1}. For implantation targeting amygdala after anchoring the screws, a 27-gauge needle was lowered to the target coordinate, left for \SI{5}{\min}, and slowly retracted to create a canal for the thin lens implant.

The mini-microscope was then fixed on the stereotaxic frame and gradually lowered to \SI{0.2}{\mm} above the target coordinates (\gls{ca1}: \gls{a/p} \SI{-1.8}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} \SI{1.5}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{-1.3}{\mm} from Bregma; \gls{la}: \gls{a/p} \SI{-1.4}{\mm}, \gls{m/l} \SI{3.4}{\mm}, \gls{d/v} \SI{-4.8}{\mm} from Bregma). Opaque black dental acrylic was applied to secure the microscope baseplate to the skull. Once the dental acrylic was cured, the microscope body was detached from the baseplate and replaced with a cap. Mice were given \SI{5}{\mg\per\kg} ketoprofen for analgesia before returned to a clean cage for recovery.

\subsection{In vivo mini-microscope testing}
After lens implantation, the mice were kept in the home cage for at least two weeks before the first image session. This time allows the optical window to clear. Following this recovery, the mice were handled and the cap was removed and replaced with the microscope body. A typical imaging session lasted for at least \SI{5}{\minute}. After the imaging session, the microscope body was removed, the mice were recapped and returned to their home cage.

\subsection{Image analysis}

\subsubsection{Extracting cells from calcium imaging videos}

All calcium activity traces were normalized to have zero median and unit noise standard deviation. The noise standard deviation was estimated from median absolute deviation of the trace. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) was calculated as the ratio of maximum signal intensity and noise standard deviation. Only traces with more than 10 SNR and animals with more than 20 cells were included in the analysis. The average activity of a cell was calculated by the area under the calcium trace above 3 standard deviation of the noise divided by duration.

Before processing, the raw videos were corrected for uneven illumination by applying a high-pass Gaussian filter (\SI{20 x 20}{\um} kernel) to each frame. To reduce computational time, the videos were then down-sampled to 5 fps for processing. Individual cell calcium signals were extracted from the video similarly to previously described \citep{mukamel09}. First, the illumination-corrected down-sampled video was regarded as a matrix of pixels by time, and \gls{pca} was applied to reduce the temporal dimension to 300-500 components. The principal components were then regarded as mixtures of individual cells, and separated by \gls{ica}. \Gls{ica} components with a single mode and 90\% peak width of less than \SI{30}{\um} were classified as cells. The time-course of cell components were calculated by multiplying the inverse of \gls{ica} component matrix with the corresponding illumination-corrected raw video.

\subsubsection{Mapping cells across session}
Cells were extracted from the recordings for both the training and test session respectively. The position of the each cell was calculated as the center of mass of pixels above the \num{90} percentile intensity in the extracted \gls{ica} components. The position of cells for each recording were approximately aligned to have overlapping centers of mass, then rotated to have overlapping principle component vectors. The two point clouds were then precisely aligned using a manual approximation and finally \gls{trimicp} \citep{chetverikov02}. \Gls{trimicp} is robust against outliers, which allows accurate alignment even when cells were observed in one session but were missing in another. \Gls{trimicp} was performed using a \SI{40}{\percent} outlier ratio, optimizing both translation and rotation. After alignment, cells that shifted less than \SI{2}{\um} from one session to another were marked as the same cell. 


\section{Results}

\subsection{Capability and \textit{in vitro} testing of the mini-microscope}
The mini-microscope provides an easy and inexpensive tool for neuroscience laboratories to measure calcium activity in freely behaving animals. Our completely assembled mini-microscope weighs less than \SI{3}{\g}, and can be bounded in a \SI{25 x 16 x 11}{\mm} box (Figure~\ref{f.scope}). Adult mice with the mini-microscope attached are able to rear, groom, and freely explore environment with no noticeable change from their natural behaviour.

The theoretical optical resolution of the mini-microscope is \SI{1}{\um}. To measure the resolution empirically, we tested the mini-microscope against \gls{usaf} resolution target (38-257, Edmund Optics). As shown in Figure~\ref{f.usaf}, the thinest lines (group 7 element 6, \SI{2.07}{\um} width) are clearly distinguishable. This suggests that the empirical resolution of the microscope is smaller than \SI{2}{\um}. With this resolution, the mini-microscope is able to resolve cell bodies and capillary blood vessels.

We first tested the mini-microscope in a perfused fluorescent brain. We virally expressed \gls{gfp} in the \gls{la} of a mice using \gls{hsv}, and perfused and harvested the brain 3 days later when the \gls{gfp} expression had peaked. The brain was sliced coronally on a vibratome until fluorescence was detectable on the cutting surface. The trunk of the brain was then imaged under the mini-microscope. As seen in Figure~\ref{f.scope-gfp}, the \gls{gfp} cell bodies and the apical dendrites could be resolved from the mini-microscope image. This result confirms that the fluorescence under  \gls{led} illumination can be reliably detected by the \gls{cmos} camera.

\subsection{Measuring blood flow with mini-microscope}
To test the \textit{in vivo} imaging capabilities of the microscope, we first implanted the mini-microscope above the cortex, and injected \SI{150}{\ul} of fluorescein-dextran (molecular weight \SI{150}{\kilo\dalton}; FD150, Sigma) in the mouse tail vein. Fluorescein-dextran fills the blood vessels, and leads to fluorescence with similar excitation and emission wavelengths to GCaMP. As expected, after fluorescein-dextran injection, the blood vessels were clearly visible when the microscope is implanted (Figure~\ref{f.bloodvessel}). The resolution of the mini-microscope allows identification of individual eurythrocytes in the capillaries, and therefore the eurythrocyte flow rate can be calculated and shown in Figure~\ref{fig.sub.vel}. This measurement allows using the mini-microscope to study haemodynamic responses in the capillaries in freely behaving mice.

\subsection{Recording calcium transients in \gls{ca1}}
To test GCaMP6s expression \textit{in vivo}, we infused AAV--syn--GCaMP6s--WPRE into \gls{ca1} hippocampus and implanted the mini-microscope above the injection site. During a behavioural session, the mouse was placed in a novel environment to explore for \SI{5}{\minute}, during which GCaMP6 fluorescence was recorded by the mini-microscope. The maximum projection of the GCaMP6 fluorescence in a 5-minute session is shown in Figure~\ref{f.ca1bw}. We were able to extract 200 cells and their corresponding \ce{Ca^2+} transients from the recording (Figure~\ref{f.analysis}, \ref{f.ca1rainbow}).

The positions of the mouse was traced out in the behaviour video. The timecourse of the identified cells was mapped back onto the behaviour of the mouse. Figure~\ref{f.traceplot} shows \ce{Ca^2+} activity of potential place cells as they responded to specific locations in the environment the animal was in.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Video preprocessing}
\subsubsection{Illumination correction}
The size of the mini-microscope limits its illumination pathway, and as a result the illumination in the \gls{fov} is uneven. Uneven illumination not only affects the calcium signal and cell detection, but also adds difficulty to the motion correction step, since the uneven illumination pattern appears stable even when there is relative movement between the mini-microscope and the target. To correct this, a 2D Gaussian filter with large window (\SI{20x20}{\um}) was convolved with each frame. The lower frequency image was regarded as the illumination pattern. The illumination pattern was then subtracted from the frame and normalized. Figure~\ref{f.illumination} shows the maximum projection of an \textit{in vivo} video recording of \gls{ca1} cells expressing gCaMP6f before and after illumination correction. Cells under intense illumination in the center can be clearly visualized after illumination correction.

Cells in the center of the \gls{fov} are clearly visible after illumination correction. \label{f.illumination}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Motion correction}
After illumination correction, the video was then de-dusted and corrected for motion. Occasional dust speckles on the camera appear as stationary small dark objects in the video, and interfere with motion detection. To remove the dust speckles, pixels two standard deviation darker than mean intensity were labelled for each frame. The labelled pixels were morphologically eroded and dilated to remove labelling noise, and then inpainted using Navier-Stokes based methods \citep{bertalmio01}.

As camera motion is almost entirely translational, after dust removal we used phase correlation algorithm to achieved sub-pixel level motion correction \citep{guizar08}. The reference frame was initialized to be the first frame. A moving average of 25 registered frames was generated, and the reference frame was updated by maximum projection of the moving average frame to the reference frame. To test the efficacy of the motion correction algorithm, we generated a recording with significant motion artifacts by loosing the connection of the mini-microscope to the baseplate during recording. As can be seen from the maximum projection of the original recording and stabilized recording (Figure~\ref{f.motion}), after motion correction, we are able to obtain a stable image of cells, even with significant motion artifacts in the original video.

\subsection{Between session stability}
To measure the stability of the imaging field between sessions, animals with gCaMP6 infused in \gls{ca1} underwent contextual fear conditioning, and \SI{24}{\hour} later, were placed back in the same context for testing. The mini-microscope was attached during both imaging sessions, and the recordings are aligned as shown in Figure \ref{f.cellalign}. In this mouse, we are able to detect 88 active cells from day 1 and 70 active cells from day 2. We were able to align videos from both sessions and found 57 cells active for both sessions. This result is similar to previously reported results \citep{ziv13}, and validates our method to map cells between sessions.

\subsection{Deep brain imaging}
The original design of the miniature microscope incorporated an objective lens of \SI{1.8}{\mm} in diameter. This lens is both too thick and too short to reach deep brain structures such as \gls{la}. We modified the design and attached a \SI{4.8}{\mm} long \SI{0.5}{\mm} diameter relay \gls{grin} lens (ILW-050-P100, GoFoton) to the objective lens. Attaching the relay lens does not significantly alter the imaging ability of the mini-microscope, but allows the lens to reach deep brain regions without extensive damage. With this configuration, we were able to record neural activity form more than 40 cells in \gls{la} and track them over time (Figure~\ref{f.amygdala}).

\subsection{Two colour}
To test the two-colour version of the mini-microscope, we infused red retrobeads (Lumafluor) into the \gls{nac} bilaterally and gCaMP6-expressing \gls{aav} in \gls{la}. The retrobeads were trafficked retrogradely along axons, and labelled \gls{la} neurons that project to \gls{nac}. The images acquired from both the green and red channel are shown in Figure~\ref{f.twocolour.g.invivo} and \ref{f.twocolour.r.invivo}. Importantly, there is no interference between the two channels.

\section{Discussion}

In the current project, we developed a miniature integrated microscope for calcium imaging in freely behaving mice. The mini-microscope weighs less than \SI{3}{\gram}, and can be implanted on a mouse's head without altering the mouse's natural behaviour. We successfully used this microscope to record calcium transients both from \gls{ca1} in dorsal hippocampus and \gls{la}. Moreover, we added an additional red colour channel for subpopulation identification. With the additional colour channel, we have shown that it is possible to identify cells with specific projection targets by retrograde tracing using fluorescent retrobeads. 

Compared to previously designed mini-microscopes, our design is simpler to build and more cost efficient, which makes it suitable for common neuroscience laboratories. All optical and electronic parts are commercially available, and the casing can be 3D-printed. The mini-microscope is designed to be easily assembled with minimal tools. The design allows biology researchers with minimal engineering experience to build the mini-microscope and use it for biological research. Moreover, the complete cost a single mini-microscope is between \$\,300 and \$\,1000, and will not represent a significant expense to most biology laboratories.

Here we used PCA--ICA for sorting the cells from videos. It is worth noting that although this method can extract cells and traces reliably, it is not optimal: the PCA--ICA method can only catch statistical regularities in the cell activity, but any spatial information is ignored. As a result, if the statistical distribution of cell activity is similar between some cells, for example if the duration of the video is relatively short or there are cells fire in synchrony, the PCA--ICA is unable to extract individual cells correctly. In addition, the results of PCA--ICA may include negative values in cell activity, which should be limited to only positive values. Recently, \citet{pnevmatikakis16} used a \gls{cnmf} approach for cell sorting from calcium imaging videos. This method took into consideration of the spatial information of each cell, as well as the activity signature of the calcium indicators, and has been shown to be more accurate than PCA--ICA in videos acquired from two-photon microscopes.  It is promising that a similar \gls{cnmf} approach can be applied to the mini-microscope dataset for cell sorting. 

However, comparing to \textit{in vivo} two-photon calcium imaging, our mini-microscope lacks the advantage of focusing deeper from the \gls{grin} lens surface, as well as providing an optical slicing of the volume. The latter generates a challenge especially in cell sorting, as overlapping cells in the mini-microscope image may not be separated easily. While the \gls{pca}--\gls{ica} methods is able to resolve and distinguish partially overlapped cells \citet{mukamel09}, it is unable to distinguish two completely overlapped cells. 

Again, this limitation is can be largely resolved by \citet{pnevmatikakis16}'s \gls{cnmf} approach. They have shown that with their approach, they are able to correctly segregate and recover two overlapping cells \citet{pnevmatikakis16}. Moreover, \citet{yang16} showed that they are able to recover calcium activity recorded from simultaneous multi-plane two-photon imaging, where the cells from different z-planes are mixed together. The ability to separate overlapping cells make the \gls{cnmf} especially attractive for the mini-microscope recordings, especially in brain regions where cell density is high, and a significant portion of recorded cells overlap with each other.

In the two-colour version of the mini-microscope, colour aberration still exists, such that the alignment of the red and green channels is not perfect. However, the colour aberration is not significant, and will only result in a theoretical shift of \SI{2}{\um} in the field of view. Given that the diameter of a neuron is usually more than \SI{10}{\um}, this misalignment will not significantly affect the identification of neural subpopulations in the red channel. The colour aberration is primarily introduced by the \gls{grin} lens, and can be corrected by using a \gls{grin} lens with an optimal radial refractory index profile. However although technically possible, such \gls{grin} lens is not currently available commercially.
