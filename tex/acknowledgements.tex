First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Sheena Josselyn for her exceptional guidance, advice, and motivation. Sheena has taught me important skills and scientific rigor, and has made graduate school an extremely fulfilling experience. Sheena's precise and simple way of communicating complicated ideas has always been a model I am trying to achieve. I would also like to thank my program advisory committee members: Dr. Junchul Kim, Dr. Christopher Yip and Dr. Fang Liu. Your suggestions and feedbacks during committee meeting has greatly pushed the project forward, sometimes in unexpected ways. 

I am privileged to work with Dr. Paul Frankland and the brilliant members in the Josselyn \slash Frankland lab during the PhD program. I would like to thank Paul for always being helpful and supportive, and providing great new ideas for experiments and analysis. Much of my gratitude goes to Dr. Valentina Mercaldo, who agrees to be the unfortunate pilot user of the bug-ridden mini-microscope prototype and can actually endure it --- this work will not exist if not for her unreasonable perseverance and euthusiasm. I would like to thank Alexander Jacob for help with building and refining the mini-microscope design, and Dr. Ying Meng for discussions about Alzheimer disease and input for the thesis. I would also like to particularly thank Dr. Asim Rashid, with whom I collaborated in a project unrelated to this thesis. His composed attitude for science and life in general has made graduate school much less stressful than it supposed to be. 

Besides the Josselyn \slash Frankland lab members, I also received tremendous help for Dr. Nathan Insel and Dr. David Redish, and I am grateful for their deep insights and critics for the mini-microscope data and analysis. 

This long journey of graduate school is not without exceptional support from my friends and family.  I would like to thank Miao, Xiangyuan, and Mengchen for the many sleepless nights where failures in graduate school are laughed out. I would also like to thank my parents for their unconditional support, even though I never seem to do what they predict. Lastly and most importantly, I cannot come this far without the tremendous love and support from my wife Wei. Thank you for your understanding and patience, and for making me feel like a giant by keeping my head in the cloud and feet on the ground.
