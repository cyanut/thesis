I am among a lucky few to enter graduate school under such exceptional mentorship of Dr. Sheena Josselyn, and it's hard to overstate my gratitude for Sheena's motivation, guidance and advice over the PhD program. Sheena's unwavering encouragement and support gave me the couragement to transition from molecular biology to engineering and computational neuroscience with no prior experience, and made graduate school extremely fulfilling. Sheena has shown me what an iconic scientist is: knowledgeable yet humble, rigorous yet open-minded, passionate yet meticulate. I would also like to thank my program advisory committee members: Dr. Junchul Kim, Dr. Christopher Yip and Dr. Fang Liu. Your suggestions and feedbacks during committee meetings has greatly pushed the project forward, sometimes in unexpected ways. 

I am tremendously privileged to work with Dr. Paul Frankland and the brilliant members in the Josselyn \slash{} Frankland lab during the PhD program. I would like to thank Paul for always being helpful and supportive, and providing great new ideas for experiments and analysis. Much of my gratitude goes to Dr. Valentina Mercaldo, who agrees to be the unfortunate pilot user of the bug-ridden mini-microscope prototype and actually endured it --- this work will not exist if not for her unreasonable perseverance and euthusiasm. I would like to thank Alexander Jacob for help with building and refining the mini-microscope design, and Dr. Ying Meng for discussions about Alzheimer disease and input for the thesis. I would also like to particularly thank Dr. Asim Rashid, with whom I collaborated in a project unrelated to this thesis. His guidance and infectiously composed attitude, both for science and life in general, has made me feel much less stressful in graduate school than it supposed to be. Besides the Josselyn \slash{} Frankland lab members, I also received tremendous help for Dr. Nathan Insel and Dr. David Redish. I am grateful for their sharp ideas, deep insights and constructive critics for the mini-microscope data and analysis. 

This long journey of graduate school is not without exceptional support from my friends and family.  I would like to thank Miao, Xiangyuan, and Mengchen for the many sleepless nights where failures in graduate school are laughed out. I would also like to thank my parents for their unconditional support and encouragement for the pursuit of my passion. Last but not the least, I cannot come this far without the tremendous love and support from my wife Wei. Thank you for your understanding and patience, and for making me feel like a giant by keeping my head in the clouds and feet on the ground.
