First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Sheena Josselyn for providing exceptional guidance, advice, and motivation. I cannot imagine a better PhD supervisor: Sheena has taught be important skills and scientific rigor, and has made graduate school an extremely fulfilling experience. Sheena's precise and simple way of communicating complicated ideas has always been a model I am trying to achieve. I would also like to thank my program advisory committee members: Dr. Junchul Kim, Dr. Christopher Yip and Dr. Fang Liu. Your suggestions and feedbacks during committee meeting has greatly pushing the project forward, sometimes in unexpected ways. 

I am privileged to know Dr. Paul Frankland and members in the Josselyn / Frankland lab. I would like to thank Paul for always being helpful and supportive, and providing many sparks of great new ideas for experiments and analysis. Much of my gratitude goes to Dr. Valentina Mercaldo, who agrees to be the unfortunate pilot user of the bug-ridden mini-microscope prototype and can actually endure it --- this work will not exist if not for her unreasonable perseverance and euthusiasm. I would also like to thank Dr. Yasaman Soudagar for sling-shotting me from behavioural neuroscience into physics and engineering and muffled the scream. I would also like to particularly thank Dr. Asim Rashid, with whom I collaborated in many projects unrelated to this thesis project. His composed attitude for science and life in general has made graduate school much less stressful than it should be. 

I would also like to thank Dr. Nathan Insel and Dr. David Redish for the critical view of the data analysis method.  , and it has been a huge compliment to get a yes from either of you! 

This long journey of graduate school is not without exceptial support from my friends and family.  I would like to thank Miao, Xiangyuan, and Mengchen for the many sleepless nights where failures in graduate school are laughed out in proud. I would also like to thank my parents, Xiao and Hua, for their unconditional support, even though I never seem to be doing what they predict. Lastly and most importantly, I cannot come this far without the tremendous love and support from my wife Wei. Thank you for your understanding and patience, and for keeping my head in the cloud, and feet on the ground.
